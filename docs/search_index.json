There is an unnecessary dichotomy in linguistics “intuiting” linguistic data Inventing sentences exemplifying the phenomenon under investigation and then judging their grammaticality Corpus data Highlight the importance of language use in real context Highlight the linguistic tendency in the population (from a sample) Strengths of Corpus Data Data reliability How sure can we be that other people will arrive at the same observations/patterns/conclusions using the same method? Can others replicate the same logical reasoning in intuiting data? Can others make the same “grammatical judgement”? Data validity How well do we understand what real world phenomenon that the data correspond to? Can we know more about language based on one man’s constructed sentences or his grammatical judgement? Can we better generalize our insights from one man’s intuition or the group minds (population vs. sample vs. one-man)? 1.2 What is corpus? This can be tricky: different disciplines, different definitions Literature History Sociology Field Linguistics Linguistic Corpus in corpus linguistics (Stefanowitch 2019) Authentic Representative Large A few well-received definitions “a collection of texts which have been selected and brought together so that language can be studied on the computer” (Wynne 2005) “A corpus is a collection of pieces of language text in electronic form, selected according to external criteria to represent, as far as possible, a language or language variety as a source of data for linguistic research.” (John Sinclair in (Wynne 2005)) “A corpus refers to a machine-readable collection of (spoken or written) texts that were produced in a natural communitive setting, and in which the collection of texts is compiled with the intention (1) to be representative and balanced with respect to a particular linguistic language, variety, register, or genre and (2) to be analyzed linguistically.” (Gries 2018) 1.3 What is a corpus linguistic study? CL characteristics No general agreement as to what it is Not a very homogenous methodological framework (Compared to other sub-disciplines in linguistics) It’s quite new Intertwined with many linguistic fields Interactional linguistics, cognitive linguistics, functional syntax, usage-based grammar etc. Stylometry, computational linguistics, NLP, digital humanities, text mining, sentiment analysis Corpus-based vs. Corpus-driven (cf. Tognini-Bonelli 2001) Corpus-based studies: Typically use corpus data in order to explore a theory or hypothesis, aiming to validate it, refute it or refine it. Take corpus linguistics as a method Corpus-driven studies: Typically reject the characterization of corpus linguistics as a method Claim instead that the corpus itself should be the sole source of our hypotheses about language It is thus claimed that the corpus itself embodies a theory of language (Tognini-Bonelli 2001, 84–85) Stefanowitch (2019) defines Corpus Linguistics as follows: Corpus linguistics is the investigation of linguistic research questions that have been framed in terms of the conditional distribution of linguistic phenomena in a linguistic corpus More on Conditional Distribution An exhaustive investigation Text-processing technology Retrieval and coding Regular expressions Common methods KWIC concordances Collocates Frequency lists A systematic investigation The distribution of a linguistic phenomenon under particular conditions (e.g. lexical, syntactic, social, pragmatic etc. contexts) Statistical properties of language Examples When do English speakers use the complementizer that? What are the differences between small and little? When do English speaker choose “He picked up the book” vs. “He picked the book up”? When do English speaker place the adverbial clauses before the matrix clause? Do speakers use different phrases in different genres? Is the word “gay” used differently across different time periods? Do L2 learners use similar collocation patterns as do L1 speakers? Do speakers of different socio-economic classes talk differently? 1.4 Additional Information on CL Important Journals in Corpus Linguistics Corpus Linguistics and Linguistic Theory International Journal of Corpus Linguistics Corpora Applied Linguistics Computational Linguistics Digital scholarship in the Humanities Language Teaching Language Learning Journal of Second Language Writing CALL Language Teaching Research ReCALL System References "]
