In particular, we will discuss one of the most important issues in Chinese language processing, i.e., word segmentation. When we discuss English parts-of-speech tagging in Chapter 5, it is easy to perform (word) tokenization on English texts because the word boundaries in English are more clearly delimited by whitespaces. Chinese, however, does not have whitespaces between characters, which leads to a serious problem for word tokenization. We will look at the issues of word tokenization and talk about the most-often used library, jiebaR, for Chinese word segmentation. Also, we will include several case studies on Chinese text processing. In later Chapter 9, we will introduce another segmenter developed by the CKIP Group at the Academia Sinica. The CKIP Tagger seems to be the state-of-art tagger for Taiwan Mandarin, i.e., with more additional functionalities. library(tidyverse) library(tidytext) library(quanteda) library(stringr) library(jiebaR) library(readtext) 7.1 Chinese Word Segmenter jiebaR 7.1.1 Start First, if you haven’t installed the library jiebaR, you may need to install it manually: install.packages(&quot;jiebaR&quot;) library(&quot;jiebaR&quot;) This is the version used for this tutorial. packageVersion(&quot;jiebaR&quot;) [1] &#39;0.11&#39; Now let us take a look at a quick example. Let us assume that in our corpus, we have collected only one text document, with only a short paragraph. text &lt;- &quot;綠黨桃園市議員王浩宇爆料，指民眾黨不分區被提名人蔡壁如、黃瀞瑩，在昨（6）日才請辭是為領年終獎金。台灣民眾黨主席、台北市長柯文哲7日受訪時則說，都是按流程走，不要把人家想得這麼壞。&quot; There are two important steps in Chinese word segmentation: Initialize a jiebar object using worker() Tokenize the texts into words using the function segment() with the designated jiebar object created earlier seg1 &lt;- worker() segment(text, jiebar = seg1) [1] &quot;綠黨&quot; &quot;桃園市&quot; &quot;議員&quot; &quot;王浩宇&quot; &quot;爆料&quot; &quot;指民眾&quot; [7] &quot;黨&quot; &quot;不&quot; &quot;分區&quot; &quot;被&quot; &quot;提名&quot; &quot;人&quot; [13] &quot;蔡壁如&quot; &quot;黃&quot; &quot;瀞&quot; &quot;瑩&quot; &quot;在昨&quot; &quot;6&quot; [19] &quot;日&quot; &quot;才&quot; &quot;請辭&quot; &quot;是&quot; &quot;為領&quot; &quot;年終獎金&quot; [25] &quot;台灣民眾&quot; &quot;黨&quot; &quot;主席&quot; &quot;台北&quot; &quot;市長&quot; &quot;柯文&quot; [31] &quot;哲&quot; &quot;7&quot; &quot;日&quot; &quot;受訪&quot; &quot;時則&quot; &quot;說&quot; [37] &quot;都&quot; &quot;是&quot; &quot;按&quot; &quot;流程&quot; &quot;走&quot; &quot;不要&quot; [43] &quot;把&quot; &quot;人家&quot; &quot;想得&quot; &quot;這麼&quot; &quot;壞&quot; class(seg1) [1] &quot;jiebar&quot; &quot;segment&quot; &quot;jieba&quot; To word-tokenize the document, text, you first initialize a jiebar object, i.e., seg1, using worker() and feed this jiebar to segment(jiebar = seg1)and tokenize text into words. 7.1.2 Parameters Setting There are many different parameters you can specify when you initialize the jiebar object. You may get more detail via the documentation ?worker(). Some of the important arguments include: user = ...: This argument is to specify the path to a user-defined dictionary stop_word = ...: This argument is to specify the path to a stopword list symbol = FALSE: Whether to return symbols (the default is FALSE) bylines = FALSE: Whether to return a list or not (crucial if you are using tidytext::unnest_tokens()) Exercise 7.1 In our earlier example, when we created the jiebar object named seg1, we did not specify any arguments for worker(). Can you tell what the default settings are for the parameters of worker()? Please try to create worker() with different settings (e.g., symbols = T, bylines = T) and see how the tokenization results differ from each other. 7.1.3 User-defined dictionary From the above example, it is clear to see that some of the words have not been correctly identified by the current segmenter: for example, 民眾黨, 不分區, 黃瀞瑩, 柯文哲. It is always recommended to include a user-defined dictionary when tokenizing your texts because different corpora may have their own unique vocabulary (i.e., domain-specific lexicon). This can be done with the argument user = ... when you initialize the jiebar object, i.e, worker(..., user = ...). seg2 &lt;- worker(user = &quot;demo_data/dict-ch-user-demo.txt&quot;) segment(text, seg2) [1] &quot;綠黨&quot; &quot;桃園市&quot; &quot;議員&quot; &quot;王浩宇&quot; &quot;爆料&quot; &quot;指&quot; [7] &quot;民眾黨&quot; &quot;不分區&quot; &quot;被&quot; &quot;提名&quot; &quot;人&quot; &quot;蔡壁如&quot; [13] &quot;黃瀞瑩&quot; &quot;在昨&quot; &quot;6&quot; &quot;日&quot; &quot;才&quot; &quot;請辭&quot; [19] &quot;是&quot; &quot;為領&quot; &quot;年終獎金&quot; &quot;台灣&quot; &quot;民眾黨&quot; &quot;主席&quot; [25] &quot;台北&quot; &quot;市長&quot; &quot;柯文哲&quot; &quot;7&quot; &quot;日&quot; &quot;受訪&quot; [31] &quot;時則&quot; &quot;說&quot; &quot;都&quot; &quot;是&quot; &quot;按&quot; &quot;流程&quot; [37] &quot;走&quot; &quot;不要&quot; &quot;把&quot; &quot;人家&quot; &quot;想得&quot; &quot;這麼&quot; [43] &quot;壞&quot; The format of the user-defined dictionary is a text file, with one word per line. Also, the default encoding of the dictionary is UTF-8. Please note that in Windows, the default encoding of a Chinese txt file created by Notepad may not be UTF-8. (Usually, it is encoded in big-5). Also, files created by MS Office applications tend to be less transparent in terms of their encoding. Creating a user-defined dictionary may take a lot of time. You may consult 搜狗詞庫, which includes many domain-specific dictionaries created by others. However, it should be noted that the format of the dictionaries is .scel. You may need to convert the .scel to .txt before you use it in jiebaR. To do the coversion automatically, please consult the library cidian. Also, you need to do the traditional-simplified Chinese conversion as well. For this, you may consult the library ropencc in R. 7.1.4 Stopwords When you initialize the worker(), you can also specify a stopword list, i.e., words that you do not need to include in the later analyses. For example, in text mining, functional words are usually less informative, thus often excluded in the process of preprocessing. seg3 &lt;- worker(user = &quot;demo_data/dict-ch-user-demo.txt&quot;, stop_word = &quot;demo_data/stopwords-ch-demo.txt&quot;) segment(text, seg3) [1] &quot;綠黨&quot; &quot;桃園市&quot; &quot;議員&quot; &quot;王浩宇&quot; &quot;爆料&quot; &quot;指&quot; [7] &quot;民眾黨&quot; &quot;不分區&quot; &quot;提名&quot; &quot;人&quot; &quot;蔡壁如&quot; &quot;黃瀞瑩&quot; [13] &quot;在昨&quot; &quot;6&quot; &quot;才&quot; &quot;請辭&quot; &quot;為領&quot; &quot;年終獎金&quot; [19] &quot;台灣&quot; &quot;民眾黨&quot; &quot;主席&quot; &quot;台北&quot; &quot;市長&quot; &quot;柯文哲&quot; [25] &quot;7&quot; &quot;受訪&quot; &quot;時則&quot; &quot;說&quot; &quot;按&quot; &quot;流程&quot; [31] &quot;走&quot; &quot;不要&quot; &quot;人家&quot; &quot;想得&quot; &quot;這麼&quot; &quot;壞&quot; Exercise 7.2 How do we quickly check which words in segment(text, seg2) were removed as compared to the results of segment(text, seg3)? (Note: seg2 and seg3 only differ in the stop_word=... argument.) [1] &quot;被&quot; &quot;日&quot; &quot;是&quot; &quot;都&quot; &quot;把&quot; 7.1.5 POS Tagging So far we haven’t seen the parts-of-speech tags provided by the word segmenter. If you need the POS tags of the words, you need to specify the argument type = \"tag\" when you initialize the worker(). seg4 &lt;- worker(type = &quot;tag&quot;, #dict = &quot;demo_data/jieba-tw/dict.txt&quot;, user = &quot;demo_data/dict-ch-user-demo.txt&quot;, stop_word = &quot;demo_data/stopwords-ch-demo.txt&quot;, symbol = F) segment(text, seg4) n ns n n n n n &quot;綠黨&quot; &quot;桃園市&quot; &quot;議員&quot; &quot;王浩宇&quot; &quot;爆料&quot; &quot;指&quot; &quot;民眾黨&quot; n v n n n x x &quot;不分區&quot; &quot;提名&quot; &quot;人&quot; &quot;蔡壁如&quot; &quot;黃瀞瑩&quot; &quot;在昨&quot; &quot;6&quot; d v x n x n n &quot;才&quot; &quot;請辭&quot; &quot;為領&quot; &quot;年終獎金&quot; &quot;台灣&quot; &quot;民眾黨&quot; &quot;主席&quot; ns n n x v x zg &quot;台北&quot; &quot;市長&quot; &quot;柯文哲&quot; &quot;7&quot; &quot;受訪&quot; &quot;時則&quot; &quot;說&quot; p n v df n x r &quot;按&quot; &quot;流程&quot; &quot;走&quot; &quot;不要&quot; &quot;人家&quot; &quot;想得&quot; &quot;這麼&quot; a &quot;壞&quot; The returned object is a named character vector, i.e., the POS tags of the words are included in the names of the vectors. Every POS tagger has its own predefined tagset. The following table lists the annotations of the POS tagset used in jiebaR: Exercise 7.3 How do we convert the named word vector with POS tags returned by segment(text, seg4) into a long string as shown below?

If you like to use the jieba default stop word list, you may need to convert it into a traditional Chinese version before using it. You can also download the traditional Chinese version from demo_data/stopwords-ch-jiebar-zht.txt. The following codes show you how to do the conversion and apply the stop word list to the word segmentation. # use the jiebar default stopword list ## convert jiebar default stopword into traditional zh ## Please uncomment the following line if you need to install the package # devtools::install_github(&quot;Lchiffon/ropencc&quot;) library(ropencc) ccst = converter(S2T) ccst[&quot;开放中文转换&quot;] [1] &quot;開放中文轉換&quot; ccts = converter(T2S) ccts[&quot;開放中文轉換&quot;] [1] &quot;开放中文转换&quot; st_zhs &lt;- readLines(&quot;/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.1/Resources/library/jiebaRD/dict/stop_words.utf8&quot;) st_zht&lt;-ccst[st_zhs] con &lt;- file(&quot;demo_data/stopwords-ch-jiebar-zht.txt&quot;, open = &quot;w&quot;, encoding = &quot;utf-8&quot;) writeLines(st_zht, con) close(con) ## Use the default stopword list seg5 &lt;- worker(user = &quot;demo_data/dict-ch-user-demo.txt&quot;, stop_word = &quot;demo_data/stopwords-ch-jiebar-zht.txt&quot; ) segment(text, seg5) [1] &quot;綠黨&quot; &quot;桃園市&quot; &quot;議員&quot; &quot;王浩宇&quot; &quot;爆料&quot; &quot;指&quot; [7] &quot;民眾黨&quot; &quot;不分區&quot; &quot;提名&quot; &quot;蔡壁如&quot; &quot;黃瀞瑩&quot; &quot;在昨&quot; [13] &quot;日&quot; &quot;請辭&quot; &quot;為領&quot; &quot;年終獎金&quot; &quot;台灣&quot; &quot;民眾黨&quot; [19] &quot;主席&quot; &quot;台北&quot; &quot;市長&quot; &quot;柯文哲&quot; &quot;日&quot; &quot;受訪&quot; [25] &quot;時則&quot; &quot;說&quot; &quot;流程&quot; &quot;走&quot; &quot;不要&quot; &quot;想得&quot; [31] &quot;壞&quot; 7.1.7 Reminders When we use segment() as a tokenization method in the unnest_tokens(), it is very important to specify bylines = TRUE in worker(). This setting would make sure that segment() takes a text-based vector as input and returns a list of word-based vectors of the same size as output. NB: When bylines = FALSE, segment() returns a vector. seg_byline_1 &lt;- worker(bylines = T) seg_byline_0 &lt;- worker(bylines = F) (text_tag_1 &lt;- segment(text, seg_byline_1)) [[1]] [1] &quot;綠黨&quot; &quot;桃園市&quot; &quot;議員&quot; &quot;王浩宇&quot; &quot;爆料&quot; &quot;指民眾&quot; [7] &quot;黨&quot; &quot;不&quot; &quot;分區&quot; &quot;被&quot; &quot;提名&quot; &quot;人&quot; [13] &quot;蔡壁如&quot; &quot;黃&quot; &quot;瀞&quot; &quot;瑩&quot; &quot;在昨&quot; &quot;6&quot; [19] &quot;日&quot; &quot;才&quot; &quot;請辭&quot; &quot;是&quot; &quot;為領&quot; &quot;年終獎金&quot; [25] &quot;台灣民眾&quot; &quot;黨&quot; &quot;主席&quot; &quot;台北&quot; &quot;市長&quot; &quot;柯文&quot; [31] &quot;哲&quot; &quot;7&quot; &quot;日&quot; &quot;受訪&quot; &quot;時則&quot; &quot;說&quot; [37] &quot;都&quot; &quot;是&quot; &quot;按&quot; &quot;流程&quot; &quot;走&quot; &quot;不要&quot; [43] &quot;把&quot; &quot;人家&quot; &quot;想得&quot; &quot;這麼&quot; &quot;壞&quot; (text_tag_0 &lt;- segment(text, seg_byline_0)) [1] &quot;綠黨&quot; &quot;桃園市&quot; &quot;議員&quot; &quot;王浩宇&quot; &quot;爆料&quot; &quot;指民眾&quot; [7] &quot;黨&quot; &quot;不&quot; &quot;分區&quot; &quot;被&quot; &quot;提名&quot; &quot;人&quot; [13] &quot;蔡壁如&quot; &quot;黃&quot; &quot;瀞&quot; &quot;瑩&quot; &quot;在昨&quot; &quot;6&quot; [19] &quot;日&quot; &quot;才&quot; &quot;請辭&quot; &quot;是&quot; &quot;為領&quot; &quot;年終獎金&quot; [25] &quot;台灣民眾&quot; &quot;黨&quot; &quot;主席&quot; &quot;台北&quot; &quot;市長&quot; &quot;柯文&quot; [31] &quot;哲&quot; &quot;7&quot; &quot;日&quot; &quot;受訪&quot; &quot;時則&quot; &quot;說&quot; [37] &quot;都&quot; &quot;是&quot; &quot;按&quot; &quot;流程&quot; &quot;走&quot; &quot;不要&quot; [43] &quot;把&quot; &quot;人家&quot; &quot;想得&quot; &quot;這麼&quot; &quot;壞&quot; class(text_tag_1) [1] &quot;list&quot; class(text_tag_0) [1] &quot;character&quot; 7.2 Chinese Text Analytics Pipeline In Chapter 5, we have talked about the pipeline for English texts processing, as shown below: Figure 7.1: English Text Analytics Flowchart For Chinese texts, the pipeline is similar. In the following Chinese Text Analytics Flowchart (Figure 7.2), I have highlighted the steps that are crucial to Chinese processing. It is not recommended to use quanteda::summary() and quanteda::kwic() directly on the Chinese corpus object because the word tokenization in quanteda is not ideal (cf. dashed arrows in Figure 7.2). It is recommended to use self-defined word segmenter for analysis. For processing under tidy structure framework, use own segmenter in unnest_tokens(); For processing under quanteda framework, use self-defined word segmenter to create the tokens object, defined in quanteda as well. Figure 7.2: Chinese Text Analytics Flowchart It is important to note that when we specify a self-defined unnest_tokens(…,token=…) function, this function should take a character vector (i.e., a text-based vector) and return a list of character vectors (i.e., word-based vectors) of the same length. In other words, when initializing the Chinese word segmenter, we need to specify the argument worker(…, byline = TRUE). 7.2.1 Creating a Corpus Object So based on our simple corpus example above, we first transform the character vector text into a corpus object—text_corpus. First, let’s try the default Quanteda-native Chinese word segmentation: With the corpus object, we can apply quanteda::summary(), and the statistics of tokens and types are based on the Quanteda-native word segmentation; Or we can use the Quanteda-native tokenization method, tokens(), to convert the corpus object into tokens object and apply quanteda::kwic() to get concordance lines. ## create corpus object text_corpus &lt;- corpus(text) ## summary summary(text_corpus) ## Create tokens object text_tokens &lt;- tokens(text_corpus) ## Check quanteda-native word tokenization result text_tokens[[1]] [1] &quot;綠黨&quot; &quot;桃園市&quot; &quot;議員&quot; &quot;王&quot; &quot;浩&quot; &quot;宇&quot; [7] &quot;爆&quot; &quot;料&quot; &quot;，&quot; &quot;指&quot; &quot;民眾&quot; &quot;黨&quot; [13] &quot;不&quot; &quot;分區&quot; &quot;被&quot; &quot;提名&quot; &quot;人&quot; &quot;蔡&quot; [19] &quot;壁&quot; &quot;如&quot; &quot;、&quot; &quot;黃&quot; &quot;瀞&quot; &quot;瑩&quot; [25] &quot;，&quot; &quot;在&quot; &quot;昨&quot; &quot;（&quot; &quot;6&quot; &quot;）&quot; [31] &quot;日&quot; &quot;才&quot; &quot;請辭&quot; &quot;是&quot; &quot;為&quot; &quot;領&quot; [37] &quot;年終獎金&quot; &quot;。&quot; &quot;台灣&quot; &quot;民眾&quot; &quot;黨主席&quot; &quot;、&quot; [43] &quot;台北市&quot; &quot;長&quot; &quot;柯&quot; &quot;文&quot; &quot;哲&quot; &quot;7&quot; [49] &quot;日&quot; &quot;受&quot; &quot;訪&quot; &quot;時&quot; &quot;則&quot; &quot;說&quot; [55] &quot;，&quot; &quot;都是&quot; &quot;按&quot; &quot;流程&quot; &quot;走&quot; &quot;，&quot; [61] &quot;不要&quot; &quot;把&quot; &quot;人家&quot; &quot;想得&quot; &quot;這麼&quot; &quot;壞&quot; [67] &quot;。&quot; ## KWIC kwic(text_tokens, pattern = &quot;柯文哲&quot;) kwic(text_tokens, pattern = &quot;柯&quot;) Do you know why there are no tokens of concordance lines from kwic(text_corpus, pattern = \"柯文哲\")? It is clear to see that quite a few word tokens have not been successfully identified by the Quanteda-native word segmentation. This would also have great impact on the effectiveness of kwic() as well. Now let’s improve the word segmentation by using self-defined word segmenter based on jiebaR. 7.2.2 Tidy Structure Framework We can transform the corpus object into a text-based TIBBLE using tidy(). Also, we can generate an unique index for each row/text using row_number(). # a text-based tidy corpus text_corpus_tidy &lt;-text_corpus %&gt;% tidy %&gt;% mutate(textID = row_number()) text_corpus_tidy For word segmentation, we initialize the jiebar object using worker(). # initialize segmenter my_seg &lt;- worker(bylines = T, user = &quot;demo_data/dict-ch-user-demo.txt&quot;, symbol=T) Then, we use unnest_tokens() to tokenize the text-based TIBBLE (text_corpus_tidy) into a word-based TIBBLE (text_corpus_tidy_word). That is, texts included in the text column are tokenized into words, which are unnested into independent rows in the word column of the new TIBBLE. # tokenization text_corpus_tidy_word &lt;- text_corpus_tidy %&gt;% unnest_tokens( word, ## new tokens unnested text, ## original larger units token = function(x) ## self-defined tokenization method segment(x, jiebar = my_seg) ) text_corpus_tidy_word It can be seen that for the token parameter in unnest_tokens(), we use an anonymous function based on jieba and segment() for self-defined Chinese word segmentation. This is called anonymous functions because it has not been assigned to any object name in the current R session. You may check R language documentation for more detail on Writing Functions. 7.2.3 Quanteda Framework Under the quanteda framework, we can also create the tokens object of the corpus and do kwic() search. Most of the functions that work with corpus object can also work with tokens object in quanteda. ## create tokens based on self-defined segmentation text_tokens &lt;- text_corpus_tidy$text %&gt;% segment(jiebar = my_seg) %&gt;% as.tokens ## kwic on word tokens kwic(text_tokens, pattern = &quot;柯文哲&quot;) kwic(text_tokens, pattern = &quot;.*?[台市].*?&quot;, valuetype = &quot;regex&quot;) In Chapter 9, we will discuss another word segmenter for Taiwan Mandarin, i.e., the CKIP Tagger developed by the CKIP group of Academia Sinica. 7.3 Data In the following sections, we look at a few more case studies of Chinese text processing using the news articles collected from Apple News as our example corpus. The dataset is available in our course dropbox drive: demo_data/applenews10000.tar.gz. This data set was collected by Meng-Chen Wu when he was working on his MA thesis project with me years ago. The demo data here was a random sample of the original Apple News Corpus. 7.4 Loading Text Data When we need to load text data from external files (e.g., txt, tar.gz files), there is a simple and powerful R package for loading texts: readtext. The main function in this package, readtext(), which takes a file or a directory name from the disk or a URL, and returns a type of data.frame that can be used directly with the corpus() constructor function in quanteda, to create a quanteda corpus object. In other words, the output from readtext is a data frame, which can be directly passed on to the processing in the tidy structure framework (i.e., tidytext::unnest_tokens()). The function readtext() works on: text (.txt) files; comma-separated-value (.csv) files; XML formatted data; data from the Facebook API, in JSON format; data from the Twitter API, in JSON format; and generic JSON data. The corpus constructor command corpus() works directly on: a vector of character objects, for instance that you have already loaded into the workspace using other tools; a data.frame containing a text column and any other document-level metadata the output of readtext::readtext() # loading the corpus # NB: this may take some time ## readtext apple_df &lt;- readtext(&quot;demo_data/applenews10000.tar.gz&quot;) ## cleaning apple_df &lt;- apple_df %&gt;% filter(text != &quot;&quot;) %&gt;% #remove empty documents mutate(filename = doc_id, ## save original text filenames doc_id = row_number()) %&gt;% # revise/create new document index data.frame() ## corpus apple_corpus &lt;- corpus(apple_df) ## summary corpus summary(apple_corpus, 10) Please note that the statistics provided by summary() may be misleading because it is based on the Quanteda-native tokenization. 7.5 Initialize jiebaR Because we are going to use jiebaR for word tokenization, we first initialize the jiebaR models. Here we created two jiebaR objects, one for word tokenization only and the other for parts-of-speech tagging. # initialize segmenter ## for word segmentation only my_seg &lt;- worker(bylines = T, user = &quot;demo_data/dict-ch-user-demo.txt&quot;, symbol = T) ## for POS tagging my_seg_pos &lt;- worker( type = &quot;tag&quot;, bylines = F, user = &quot;demo_data/dict-ch-user-demo.txt&quot;, symbol = T ) Even though we have specified a user-defined dictionary in the initialization of the worker(), we can also add add-hoc new words to the model. This can be very helpful when we spot any weird segmentation results in the output. By default, new_user_word() assigns each new word with a default n tag. #Add customized terms temp_new_words &lt;-c(&quot;蔡英文&quot;) new_user_word(my_seg, temp_new_words) [1] TRUE new_user_word(my_seg_pos, temp_new_words) [1] TRUE 7.6 Case Study 1: Concordances with kwic() ## create `tokens` object using jiebaR system.time( apple_tokens&lt;-as.tokens(segment(apple_df$text, my_seg)) ) user system elapsed 6.988 0.100 7.092 # add document-level variables docvars(apple_tokens) &lt;- apple_df[c(&quot;doc_id&quot;, &quot;filename&quot;)] ## perform kwic kwic(apple_tokens, pattern= &quot;柯文哲&quot;, window = 10 ) kwic(apple_tokens, pattern=&quot;蔡英文&quot;, window = 10) library(&quot;quanteda.textplots&quot;) textplot_xray( kwic(apple_tokens, pattern= &quot;柯文哲&quot;) ) 7.7 Case Study 2: Word Frequency and Wordcloud We follow the same steps as illustrated in the above flowchart 7.2 and process the Chinese texts based on the tidy structure framework. Recall the three important steps: Load the corpus data using readtext() and create a text-based data frame of the corpus; Initialize a jieba word segmenter using worker() Tokenize the text-based data frame into a word-based tidy data frame using unnest_tokens() Please note that the output of readtext() is already a data frame, i.e., a tidy structure of the corpus. We did not use the corpus object because in this example we did not need it for further processing with other quanteda functions (e.g., kwic()). apple_df # Tokenization: Word-based DF apple_word &lt;- apple_df %&gt;% unnest_tokens( output = word, input = text, token = function(x) segment(x, jiebar = my_seg) ) %&gt;% group_by(doc_id) %&gt;% mutate(word_id = row_number()) %&gt;% # create word index within each document ungroup apple_word %&gt;% head(100) Creating unique indices for your data is very important. In corpus linguistic analysis, we often need to keep track of the original context of the word, phrase or sentence in the concordances. All these unique indices (as well as the source text filenames) would make things a lot easier. Also, if the metadata of the source documents are available, these unique indices would allow us to connect the tokenized linguistic units to the metadata information (e.g., genres, registers, author profiles) for more interesting analysis. With a word-based data frame, we can easily generate a word frequency list as well as a word cloud to have a quick overview of the word distribution of the corpus. stopwords_chi &lt;- readLines(&quot;demo_data/stopwords-ch.txt&quot;) apple_word_freq &lt;- apple_word %&gt;% filter(!word %in% stopwords_chi) %&gt;% # remove stopwords filter(word %&gt;% str_detect(pattern = &quot;\\\\D+&quot;)) %&gt;% # remove words consisting of digits count(word) %&gt;% arrange(desc(n)) library(wordcloud2) apple_word_freq %&gt;% filter(n &gt; 400) %&gt;% filter(nchar(word) &gt;= 2) %&gt;% wordcloud2(shape = &quot;star&quot;, size = 0.3) 7.8 Case Study 3: Patterns In this case study, we are looking at a more complex example. In corpus linguistic analysis, we often need to extract a particular pattern from the texts. In order to retrieve the target patterns at a high accuracy rate, we often need to make use of the additional annotations provided by the corpus. The most often-used information is the parts-of-speech tags of words. So here we demonstrate how to add POS tags information to our current tidy corpus design. Our steps are as follows: Initialize jiebar object, which performs not only word segmentation but also POS tagging; Create a self-defined function to word-seg and pos-tag each text and combine all tokens, word/tag, into a long string for each text; With the text-based apple_df, create a new column, which includes the enriched version of each text, using mutate() # define a function to word-seg and pos-tag a text tag_text &lt;- function(x, jiebar) { segment(x, jiebar) %&gt;% paste(names(.), sep = &quot;/&quot;, collapse = &quot; &quot;) } # demo of the function `tag_text()` tag_text(apple_df$text[2], my_seg_pos) [1] &quot;【/x 動/v 新聞/n ╱/x 綜合/vn 報導/n 】/x 新/a 北/ns 市/n 一名/m 18/m 歲/zg 李姓/x 男子/n ，/x 疑因/x 女友/n 要/v 分手/v ，/x 避不見面/i 也/d 不/d 接電話/l ，/x 他/r 為/zg 見/v 女友/n 一面/m ，/x 挽回/v 感情/n ，/x 竟學/x 蜘蛛人/n 攀爬/v 鐵窗/n ，/x 欲/d 潛入/v 女友/n 位於/v 5/x 樓/n 住處/n ，/x 行經/n 2/x 樓時/x 被/p 住戶/n 發現/v ，/x 他/r 誆稱/x 「/x 撿/v 鑰匙/n 」/x 矇混過關/l ，/x 但/c 仍/zg 被/p 4/x 樓/n 住戶/n 懷疑/v 是/v 小偷/d 報案/n ，/x 最後/f 雖/zg 成功/a 進入/v 5/x 樓/n 見到/v 女友/n ，/x 仍/zg 無法挽回/i 感情/n ，/x 因/p 侵入/v 住宅/n 罪嫌/n 被/p 帶回/v 警局/n ，/x 女方/n 家屬/n 不/d 提告/x 作罷/v 。/x 警方/n 指出/v ，/x 李男為/x 挽回/v 感情/n ，/x 鋌而走險/i 攀爬/v 鐵窗/n 至/p 5/x 樓/n ，/x 其/r 後方/f 就是/d 一處/m 工地/n ，/x 萬一/m 失足/v 墜落/v ，/x 後果/n 不堪設想/i ，/x 經/zg 勸說/v 後/f ，/x 讓/v 李/nr 男/n 離去/v 。/x \\n/x /x&quot; # apply `tag_text()` function to each text system.time(apple_df %&gt;% mutate(text_tag = map_chr(text, tag_text, my_seg_pos)) -&gt; apple_df) user system elapsed 7.057 0.138 7.197 apple_df %&gt;% head 7.8.1 BEI Construction This section will show you how we can make use of the POS tags for construction analysis. Let’s look at the example of 被 + ... Construction. The data retrieval procedure is now very straightforward: we only need to create a regular expression that matches our construction and go through the enriched version of the texts (i.e., text_tag column in apple_df) to identify these matches with unnest_tokens(). 1.Define a regular expression \\\\b被/p\\\\s([^/]+/[^\\\\s]+\\\\s)*?[^/]+/v for BEI-Construction, i.e., 被 + VERB 2.Use unnest_tokens() and str_extract_all() to extract target patterns and create a pattern-based data frame. # define regex patterns pattern_bei &lt;- &quot;\\\\b被/p\\\\s([^/]+/[^\\\\s]+\\\\s)*?[^/]+/v&quot; # extract patterns from corp apple_df %&gt;% select(-text) %&gt;% # `text` is the column with original raw texts unnest_tokens( output = pat_bei, ## pattern name input = text_tag, ## original base linguistic unit token = function(x) str_extract_all(x, pattern = pattern_bei) ) -&gt; result_bei result_bei Please check Chapter 5 Parts of Speech Tagging on evaluating the quality of the data retrieved by a regular expression (i.e., precision and recall). To have a more in-depth analysis of BEI construction, we can automatically identify the verb of the BEI construction. # Extract BEI + WORD result_bei &lt;- result_bei %&gt;% mutate(VERB = str_replace(pat_bei, &quot;.+\\\\s([^/]+)/v$&quot;, &quot;\\\\1&quot;)) result_bei ## Exploratory Analysis result_bei %&gt;% count(VERB) %&gt;% top_n(40, n) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x=reorder(VERB, n), y =n, fill=n)) + geom_bar(stat=&quot;identity&quot;) + coord_flip() + labs(x = &quot;Verbs in BEI Constructions&quot;, y = &quot;Frequency&quot;) # Calculate WORD frequency require(wordcloud2) result_bei %&gt;% count(VERB) %&gt;% mutate(n = log(n)) %&gt;% top_n(100, n) %&gt;% wordcloud2(shape = &quot;diamond&quot;, size = 0.3) Exercise 7.4 When you take a closer look at the resulting word cloud above, you would see the copular verb 是 showing up in the graph, which is counter to our native-speaker intuition. How do you check the instances of these 是 tokens? After you examine these cases, what do you think may be the source of the problem? How would you revise the regular expression to improve the data retrieval? Exercise 7.5 To more properly evaluate the quality of the pattern queries, it would be great if we still have the original texts available in the resulting data frame result_bei. How do we keep this information in the results? That is, please have one column in result_bei, which shows the original texts from which the construction token is extracted. Exercise 7.6 Please use the sample corpus, apple_df, as your data source and extract Chinese particle constructions of ... 外/內/中. Usually a space particle construction like these consists of a landmark NP (LM) and the space particle (SP). For example, in 任期內, 任期 is the landmark NP and 內 is the space particle. In this exercise, we will naively assume that the word directly preceding the space particle is our landmark NP head noun. Please (a) extract all construction tokens with these space particles and (b) at the same time identify their respective SP and LM, as shown below. Exercise 7.7 Following Exercise 7.6, please generate a frequency list of the LMs for each space particle. Show us the top 10 LMs of each space particle and arrange the frequencies of the LMs in a descending order, as shown below. Also, you may visualize the top 10 landmarks that co-occur with each space particle in a bar plot as shown below. Exercise 7.8 Following Exercise 7.7, for each space particle, please create a word cloud of its co-occuring LMs based on the top 100 LMs of each particle. PS: The word frequencies in the word clouds shown below are on a log scale. Exercise 7.9 Based on the word clouds provided in Exercise 7.8, do you find any bizarre cases? Can you tell us why? What would be the problems? Or what did we do wrong in the text preprocessing that may lead to these cases? Please discuss these issues in relation to the steps in our data processing, i.e., word segmentation, POS tagging, and pattern retrievals, and provide your alternative solutions. 7.9 Case Study 4: Lexical Bundles 7.9.1 N-grams Extraction With word boundaries, we can also analyze the recurrent multiword units in Chinese news. Here let’s take a look at the recurrent four-grams in our Chinese corpus. As the default n-gram tokenization in unnest_tokens() only works with the English data, we need to define our own ngram tokenization functions. The Chinese ngram tokenization function should: tokenize each text into word tokens create a set of ngrams from the word tokens of each text ## self defined ngram tokenizer tokenizer_ngrams &lt;- function(texts, jiebar, n = 2 , skip = 0, delimiter = &quot;_&quot;) { texts %&gt;% segment(jiebar) %&gt;% ## word tokenization as.tokens %&gt;% ## list to tokens tokens_ngrams(n, skip, concatenator = delimiter) %&gt;% ## ngram tokenization as.list ## tokens to list } In the above ngram tokenizer, we make use of tokens_ngrams() in quanteda, which creates a set of ngrams from already tokenized text objects, i.e., tokens. Because this function requires a tokens object as the input, we need to do the class conversion via as.tokens() and as.list(). Take a look at the following examples for a quick overview of tokens_ngrams(): sents &lt;- c(&quot;Jack and Jill went up the hill to fetch a pail of water&quot;, &quot;Jack fell down and broke his crown and Jill came tumbling after&quot;) sents_tokens &lt;- tokens(sents) ## English supported tokens_ngrams(sents_tokens, n = 2, skip = 0) Tokens consisting of 2 documents. text1 : [1] &quot;Jack_and&quot; &quot;and_Jill&quot; &quot;Jill_went&quot; &quot;went_up&quot; &quot;up_the&quot; &quot;the_hill&quot; [7] &quot;hill_to&quot; &quot;to_fetch&quot; &quot;fetch_a&quot; &quot;a_pail&quot; &quot;pail_of&quot; &quot;of_water&quot; text2 : [1] &quot;Jack_fell&quot; &quot;fell_down&quot; &quot;down_and&quot; &quot;and_broke&quot; [5] &quot;broke_his&quot; &quot;his_crown&quot; &quot;crown_and&quot; &quot;and_Jill&quot; [9] &quot;Jill_came&quot; &quot;came_tumbling&quot; &quot;tumbling_after&quot; tokens_ngrams(sents_tokens, n = 2, skip = 1) Tokens consisting of 2 documents. text1 : [1] &quot;Jack_Jill&quot; &quot;and_went&quot; &quot;Jill_up&quot; &quot;went_the&quot; &quot;up_hill&quot; [6] &quot;the_to&quot; &quot;hill_fetch&quot; &quot;to_a&quot; &quot;fetch_pail&quot; &quot;a_of&quot; [11] &quot;pail_water&quot; text2 : [1] &quot;Jack_down&quot; &quot;fell_and&quot; &quot;down_broke&quot; &quot;and_his&quot; [5] &quot;broke_crown&quot; &quot;his_and&quot; &quot;crown_Jill&quot; &quot;and_came&quot; [9] &quot;Jill_tumbling&quot; &quot;came_after&quot; tokens_ngrams(sents_tokens, n = 5, skip = 0) Tokens consisting of 2 documents. text1 : [1] &quot;Jack_and_Jill_went_up&quot; &quot;and_Jill_went_up_the&quot; &quot;Jill_went_up_the_hill&quot; [4] &quot;went_up_the_hill_to&quot; &quot;up_the_hill_to_fetch&quot; &quot;the_hill_to_fetch_a&quot; [7] &quot;hill_to_fetch_a_pail&quot; &quot;to_fetch_a_pail_of&quot; &quot;fetch_a_pail_of_water&quot; text2 : [1] &quot;Jack_fell_down_and_broke&quot; &quot;fell_down_and_broke_his&quot; [3] &quot;down_and_broke_his_crown&quot; &quot;and_broke_his_crown_and&quot; [5] &quot;broke_his_crown_and_Jill&quot; &quot;his_crown_and_Jill_came&quot; [7] &quot;crown_and_Jill_came_tumbling&quot; &quot;and_Jill_came_tumbling_after&quot; # examples texts &lt;- c(&quot;這是一個測試的句子&quot;, &quot;這句子&quot;, &quot;超短句&quot;, &quot;最後一個超長的句子測試&quot;) tokenizer_ngrams( texts = texts, jiebar = my_seg, n = 2, skip = 0, delimiter = &quot;_&quot; ) $text1 [1] &quot;這是_一個&quot; &quot;一個_測試&quot; &quot;測試_的&quot; &quot;的_句子&quot; $text2 [1] &quot;這_句子&quot; $text3 [1] &quot;超短_句&quot; $text4 [1] &quot;最後_一個&quot; &quot;一個_超長&quot; &quot;超長_的&quot; &quot;的_句子&quot; &quot;句子_測試&quot; tokenizer_ngrams( texts = texts, jiebar = my_seg, n = 2, skip = 1, delimiter = &quot;_&quot; ) $text1 [1] &quot;這是_測試&quot; &quot;一個_的&quot; &quot;測試_句子&quot; $text2 character(0) $text3 character(0) $text4 [1] &quot;最後_超長&quot; &quot;一個_的&quot; &quot;超長_句子&quot; &quot;的_測試&quot; tokenizer_ngrams( texts = texts, jiebar = my_seg, n = 5, skip=0, delimiter = &quot;/&quot; ) $text1 [1] &quot;這是/一個/測試/的/句子&quot; $text2 character(0) $text3 character(0) $text4 [1] &quot;最後/一個/超長/的/句子&quot; &quot;一個/超長/的/句子/測試&quot; With the self-defined ngram tokenizer, we can now perform the ngram tokenization on our Chinese corpus: We transform the text-based data frame into an ngram-based data frame using unnest_tokens(...) with the self-defined tokenization function tokenizer_ngrams() We remove empty and unwanted n-grams entries Empty ngrams due to short texts Ngrams spanning punctuations, symbols, or paragraph breaks Ngrams including alphanumeric characters ## from text-based to ngram-based system.time( apple_df %&gt;% unnest_tokens( ngram, text, token = function(x) tokenizer_ngrams( texts = x, jiebar = my_seg, n = 4, skip = 0, delimiter = &quot;_&quot; ) ) -&gt; apple_ngram ) ## end system.time user system elapsed 32.288 5.231 23.449 ## remove unwanted ngrams apple_ngram2 &lt;- apple_ngram %&gt;% filter(nzchar(ngram)) %&gt;% ## empty strings filter(!str_detect(ngram, &quot;[^\\u4E00-\\u9FFF_]&quot;)) ## remove unwanted ngrams In the above regular expression, the Unicode range [\\u4E00-\\u9FFF] includes frequently used Chinese characters. Therefore, the way we remove unwanted ngrams is to identify all the ngrams that include non-Chinese characters that are outside of this Unicode range (as well as the delimiter _). For more information related to the Unicode range for the punctuations in CJK languages, please see this SO discussion thread. 7.9.2 Frequency and Dispersion As we have discussed in Chapter 4, a multiword unit can be defined based on at least two important distributional properties: The frequency of the whole multiword unit (i.e., frequency) The number of texts where the multiword unit is observed (i.e., dispersion) Now that we have the four-grams-based DF, we can compute their token frequencies and document frequencies in the corpus using the normal data manipulation tricks. We set cut-offs for four-grams at: dispersion &gt;= 5 (i.e., four-grams that occur in at least five different documents) system.time( apple_ngram_dist &lt;- apple_ngram2 %&gt;% group_by(ngram) %&gt;% summarize(freq = n(), dispersion = n_distinct(doc_id)) %&gt;% filter(dispersion &gt;= 5) ) #end system.time user system elapsed 56.191 0.340 56.530 Please take a look at the four-grams, arranged by frequency and dispersion respectively: # arrange by dispersion apple_ngram_dist %&gt;% arrange(desc(dispersion)) %&gt;% head(10) # arrange by freq apple_ngram_dist %&gt;% arrange(desc(freq)) %&gt;% head(10) We can also look at four-grams with particular lexical words: apple_ngram_dist %&gt;% filter(str_detect(ngram, &quot;被&quot;)) %&gt;% arrange(desc(dispersion)) apple_ngram_dist %&gt;% filter(str_detect(ngram, &quot;以&quot;)) %&gt;% arrange(desc(dispersion)) Exercise 7.10 In the above example, if we are only interested in the four-grams with the word 以, how can we revise the regular expression so that we can get rid of tokens like ngrams with 以及, 以上 etc. 7.10 Afterwords Figure 7.3: Chinese Word Segmentation and POS Tagging Tokenizations are complex in Chinese text processing. Many factors may need to be taken into account when determining the right tokenization method. While word segmentation is almost a necessary step in Chinese computational text analytics, several important questions may also be relevant to the data processing methods: Do you need the parts-of-speech tags of words in your research? What is the base unit you would like to work with? Texts? Paragraphs? Chunks? Sentences? N-grams? Words? Do you need non-word tokens such as symbols, punctuations, numbers, or alphabets in your analysis? Your answers to the above questions should help you determine the most effective structure of the tokenization methods for your data. 7.11 More Exercises Exercise 7.11 Please scrape the articles on the most recent 10 index pages of the PTT Gossipping board. Analyze all the articles whose titles start with [問卦], [新聞], or [爆卦] (Please ignore all articles that start with Re:). Specifically, please create the word frequency list of these target articles by: including only words that are tagged as nouns or verbs by JiebaR (i.e., all words whose POS tags start with n or v) removing words on the stopword list (cf. demo_data/stopwords-ch.txt) providing both the word frequency and dispersions (i.e., number of articles where it occurs) In addition, please visualize your results with a wordcloud as shown below, showing the recent hot words based on these recently posted target articles on PTT Gossipping. In the wordcloud, please include words whose (a) nchar() &gt;=2, and (b) dispersion &lt;= 5. Note: For Chinese word segementation, you may use the dictionary provided in demo_data/dict-ch-user.txt The target articles from PTT Gossipping: Word Frequency List [1] TRUE [1] TRUE Wordclound Exercise 7.12 If you look at your word frequency list, it is very likely that you will see puzzling tokens. And you may wonder why these tokens have high frequency counts and whether these high frequency numbers are due to the wrong word segmentation. For example, in my results, I have a token 陳 on the top of the frequency list. How can we check the concordance lines of one specific token so that we can decide whether to include new words in the user dictionary before word segmentation? For example, based on the following concordance lines, I can see why I have 陳 in my data, and maybe I can consider including 陳吉仲 in the user defined dictionary. Exercise 7.13 Based on the PTT data you get from the previous exercise, examine the recurrent lexical bundles from these articles that satisfy the following distributional criteria: all four to six contiguous word sequences (i.e., 4-grams to 6-grams) ngrams occurring in more than 5 articles ngrams that do NOT include line/paragraph breaks or symbols (non-Chinese characters) "]]
