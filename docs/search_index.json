This is a grad-level course, which is devoted to Corpus Linguistics. Have you decided to embark on a digital journey to your future career, there are a series of courses provided in the Department of English, NTNU, Taiwan, offerring necessary inter-disciplinary skills and knowledge. This course requires as prerequisite basic knoweldge of computational coding. It is highly recommended for students to have taken ENC2055 or other equivalents before taking this course. Please see the FAQ of the course webiste for more information about the prerequisite. Course Objective This course aims to introduce theories and practices of Corpus Linguistics as a scientific discipline of its own. Corpus Linguistics has now been considered an interdisciplinary subject, requiring knowledge of linguistic theories, quantitative statistics and data processing. Therefore, this course aims to provide the necessary foundation as well as computational skills for students who are interested in conducting corpus-based linguistic research or language-related research. Students are expected to learn: the methodological foundations of Corpus Linguistics the theoretical bases of Corpus Linguistics the technical designs and configuration of standard corpora how to adopt corpus linguistics as a scientific method in terms of: corpus creation operationalization data retrieval quantifying research questions significance testing the common applications of corpus-linguistic methodology: concordances frequency lists collocations keywords lexical bundles word clouds vector-space representation of words and texts This course is extremely hands-on and will lead the students through classic examples of these corpus-based applications via in-class tutorial sessions and take-home assignments. The main objective of this course is to provide students enough computational skills to perform similar corpus-based analyses on their own data or research questions. Also, it will provide specific hands-on tutorials to equip students with the necessary skills of text and statistical processing. This course will be a prerequisite for more advanced courses such as Computational Linguistics and Quantitative Corpus Linguistics. Textbook We will be using Stefanowitch (2019) as our reference material for the course. However, we will stress the hands-on implementation of the ideas and methods covered in the book. Also, there are a few more reference books listed at the end of the section, which I would highly recommend (e.g., Gries (2018), Baayen (2008), Brezina (2018), McEnery and Hardie (2011)). Course Website We have a course website. You may need a password to access the course materials. If you are an officially enrolled student, please ask the instructor for the passcode. Please read the FAQ of the course website before course registration.
