Its major features are that it's easy to use, supports both procedural and object-oriented (OO) programming, has powerful built-in support for text processing, and has one of the world's most impressive collections of third-party modules.\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nLanguage features\\n\\nThe overall structure of Perl derives broadly from the programming language C. Perl is a procedural programming language, with variables, expressions, assignment statements, brace-delimited code blocks, control structures, and subroutines.\\n\\nPerl also takes features from shell programming. All variables are marked with leading sigils. Sigils unambiguously identify variable names, allowing Perl to have a rich syntax. Importantly, sigils allow variables to be interpolated directly into strings. Like the Unix shells, Perl has many built-in functions for common tasks, like sorting, and for accessing system facilities.\\n\\nPerl takes lists from Lisp, associative arrays from awk, and regular expressions from sed. These simplify and facilitate all manner of parsing, text handling, and data management tasks.\\n\\nIn Perl 5, features were added that support complex data structures, first-class functions (i.e. closures as values), and an object-oriented programming model. These include references, packages, and class-based method dispatch. Perl 5 also saw the introduction of lexically scoped variables, which make it easier to write robust code, and modules, which make it practical to write and distribute libraries of Perl code.\\n\\nAll versions of Perl do automatic data typing and memory management. The interpreter knows the type and storage requirements of every data object in the program; it allocates and frees storage for them as necessary. Legal type conversions are done automatically at run time; illegal type conversions are fatal errors.\\n[edit]\\n\\nApplications\\n\\nPerl has many and varied applications.\\n\\nIt has been used since the early days of the Web to write CGI scripts, and is an integral component of the popular LAMP (Linux / Apache / MySQL / Perl, PHP, and Python) platform for web development. Large projects written in Perl include Slash, early implementations of PHP [1], and UseModWiki, the wiki software used in Wikipedia until 2002.\\n\\nPerl is often used as a \"glue language\", tying together systems and interfaces that were not specifically designed to interoperate. Systems administrators use Perl as an all-purpose tool; short Perl programs can be entered and run on a single command line.\\n\\nPerl is widely used in finance and bioinformatics, where it is valued for rapid application development, ability to handle large data sets, and the availability of many standard and third-party modules.\\n[edit]\\n\\nImplementation\\n\\nPerl is implemented as a core interpreter, written in C, together with a large collection of modules, written in Perl and C. The source distribution is, as of 2005, 12 MB when packaged in a tar file and compressed. The interpreter is 150,000 lines of C code and compiles to a 1 MB executable on typical machine architectures. Alternately, the interpreter can be compiled to a link library and embedded in other programs. There are nearly 500 modules in the distribution, comprising 200,000 lines of Perl and an additional 350,000 lines of C code. Much of the C code in the modules consists of character encoding tables.\\n\\nThe interpreter has an object-oriented architecture. All the elements of the Perl language \\u0097 scalars, arrays, hashes, coderefs, file handles \\u0097 are represented in the interpreter by C structs. Operations on these structs are defined by a large collection of macros, typedefs and functions; these constitute the Perl C API. The Perl API can be bewildering to the uninitiated, but its entry points follow a consistent naming scheme, which provides guidance to those who use it.\\n\\nThe execution of a Perl program divides broadly into two phases: compile-time and run-time. At compile time, the interpreter parses the program text into a syntax tree. At run time, it executes the program by walking the tree. The text is parsed only once, and the syntax tree is subject to optimization before it is executed, so the execution phase is relatively efficient. Compile-time optimizations on the syntax tree include constant folding, context propagation, and peephole optimization.\\n\\nPerl is a dynamic language and has a complex grammar that cannot be parsed by a straight Lex/Yacc lexer/parser combination. Instead, it implements its own lexer, which coordinates with a modified GNU bison parser to resolve ambiguities in the language. It is said that \"only perl can parse Perl\", meaning that only the Perl interpreter (perl) can parse the Perl language (Perl). The truth of this was attested to by the persistent imperfections over a 15 year period of other programs that undertook to parse Perl, such as source code analyzers and auto-indenters.\\n\\nWith the release of the Perl Parsing Interface at OSCON 2005 appearing to disprove the principle, the problem has been clarified to show that while dynamic language programs can be parsed into a document structure (something that the perl interpreter itself cannot do) it is impossible to do so for the purpose of execution. Usage has since begun to slowly change to the more accurate \"Only perl can run Perl\", although Argumentum ad nauseam may mean it never fully supplants the original.\\n\\nMaintenance of the Perl interpreter has become increasingly difficult over the years. The code base has been in continuous development since 1994. The code has been optimized for performance at the expense of simplicity, clarity, and strong internal interfaces. New features have been added, yet virtually complete backwards compatibility with earlier versions is maintained. The size and complexity of the interpreter is a barrier to developers who wish to work on it.\\n\\nPerl is distributed with some 90,000 functional tests. These run as part of the normal build process, and extensively exercise the interpreter and its core modules. Perl developers rely on the functional tests to ensure that changes to the interpreter do not introduce bugs; conversely, Perl users who see the interpreter pass its functional tests on their system can have a high degree of confidence that it is working properly.\\n\\nThere is no written specification or standard for the Perl language, and no plans to create one for the current version of Perl. There has only ever been one implementation of the interpreter. That interpreter, together with its functional tests, stands as a de facto specification of the language.\\n[edit]\\n\\nAvailability\\n\\nPerl is free software, and is licensed under both the Artistic License and the GNU General Public License. It is available for most operating systems. It is particularly prevalent on Unix and Unix-like systems (such as Linux, FreeBSD, and Mac OS X), and is growing in popularity on Microsoft Windows systems.\\n\\nPerl has been ported to over a hundred different platforms, and can, with only six reported exceptions, be compiled from source on all Unix-like, POSIX-compliant or otherwise Unix-compatible platforms, including AmigaOS, BeOS, Cygwin, and Mac OS X. [2] It can also be compiled from source on Windows; however, many Windows installations lack a C compiler, so Windows users typically install a binary distribution, such as ActivePerl or IndigoPerl. A special port, MacPerl, is available for Mac OS Classic.\\n[edit]\\n\\nLanguage structure\\n[edit]\\n\\nExample Program\\n\\nIn Perl, the canonical \"Hello world\" program is:\\n\\n#!/usr/bin/perl\\nprint \"Hello, world!\\\\n\";\\n\\nThe first line is the shebang, which tells the operating system where to find the Perl interpreter. The second line prints the string Hello, world! and a newline (like a person pressing 'Return' or 'Enter').\\n\\nThe shebang is the usual way to invoke the interpreter on Unix systems. Windows systems may rely on the shebang, or they may associate a .pl file extension with the Perl interpreter.\\n\\nHere is a one-line, throw-away Perl program that does ROT13 encoding/decoding. It is entered and run directly on the command line:\\n\\nperl -pe 'tr/A-Za-z/N-ZA-Mn-za-m/' < input_file > output_file\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nData types\\n\\nPerl has three fundamental data types: scalars, lists, and hashes:\\n\\n    * A scalar is a single value; it may be a number, a string or a reference\\n    * A list is an ordered collection of scalars (a variable that holds a list is called an array)\\n    * A hash, or associative array, is a map from strings to scalars; the strings are called keys and the scalars are called values.\\n\\nAll variables are marked by a leading sigil, which identifies the data type. The same name may be used for variables of different types, without conflict.\\n\\n $foo   # a scalar\\n @foo   # a list\\n %foo   # a hash\\n\\nNumbers are written in the usual way; strings are enclosed by quotes of various kinds.\\n\\n $n     = 42;\\n $name  = \"joe\";\\n $color = 'red';\\n\\nA list is written by listing its elements, separated by commas, and enclosed by parentheses where required by operator precedence.\\n\\n @scores = (32, 45, 16, 5);\\n\\nA hash may be initialized from a list of key/value pairs.\\n\\n %favorite = (joe => 'red',\\n              sam => 'blue');\\n\\nIndividual elements of a list are accessed by providing a numerical index, in square brackets. Individual values in a hash are accessed by providing the corresponding key, in curly braces. The $ sigil identifies the accessed element as a scalar.\\n\\n $scores[2]      # an element of @scores\\n $favorite{joe}  # a value in %favorite\\n\\nMultiple elements may be accessed by using the @ sigil instead (identifying the result as a list).\\n\\n @scores[2, 3, 1]    # three elements of @scores\\n @favorite{'joe', 'sam'} # two values in %favorite\\n\\nThe number of elements in an array can be obtained by evalulating the array in scalar context or with the help of the $# sigil. The latter gives the index of the last element in the array, not the number of elements.\\n\\n $count = @friends;\\n $#friends       # the index of the last element in @friends\\n $#friends+1     # the number of elements in @friends\\n                 # this is one more than $#friends because the first element is at\\n                 # index 0, not 1\\n\\nThere are a few functions that operate on entire hashes.\\n\\n @names     = keys   %address;\\n @addresses = values %address;\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nControl structures\\n\\n    Main article: Perl control structures\\n\\nPerl has several kinds of control structures.\\n\\nIt has block-oriented control structures, similar to those in the C and Java programming languages. Conditions are surrounded by parentheses, and controlled blocks are surrounded by braces:\\n\\nlabel while ( cond ) { ... }\\nlabel while ( cond ) { ... } continue { ... }\\nlabel for ( init-expr ; cond-expr ; incr-expr ) { ... }\\nlabel foreach var ( list ) { ... }\\nlabel foreach var ( list ) { ... } continue { ... }\\nif ( cond ) { ... }\\nif ( cond ) { ... } else { ... } \\nif ( cond ) { ... } elsif ( cond ) { ... } else { ... } \\n\\nWhere only a single statement is being controlled, statement modifiers provide a lighter syntax:\\n\\nstatement if      cond ;\\nstatement unless  cond ;\\nstatement while   cond ;\\nstatement until   cond ;\\nstatement foreach list ;\\n\\nShort-circuit logical operators are commonly used to effect control flow at the expression level:\\n\\nexpr and expr\\nexpr or  expr\\n\\nThe flow control keywords next, last, return, and redo are expressions, so they can be used with short-circuit operators.\\n\\nPerl also has two implicit looping constructs:\\n\\n results = grep { ... } list\\n results = map  { ... } list\\n\\ngrep returns all elements of list for which the controlled block evaluates to true. map evaluates the controlled block for each element of list and returns a list of the resulting values. These constructs enable a simple functional programming style.\\n\\nThere is no switch statement (multi-way branch) in Perl 5. The Perl documentation describes a half-dozen ways to achieve the same effect by using other control structures, none entirely satisfactory. A very general and flexible switch statement has been designed for Perl 6. The Switch module makes most of the functionality of the Perl 6 switch available to Perl 5 programs, although it is often criticised for being a source filter, and thus failure-prone. The next stable version of Perl 5, Perl 5.10, will have the Perl 6 given/when switch-statement.\\n\\nPerl includes a goto label statement, but it is rarely used. Some consider its use poor coding practice. The implementation is slow, and situations where a goto is called for in other languages don't occur as often in Perl and are often better handled with other control structures, such as labeled loops.\\n\\nThere is also a goto &sub statement that performs a tail call. It terminates the current subroutine and immediately calls the specified sub. Use of this form is culturally accepted but unusual because it is rarely needed.\\n[edit]\\n\\nSubroutines\\n\\nSubroutines are defined with the sub keyword, and invoked simply by naming them. Subroutine definitions may appear anywhere in the program. Parentheses are required for calls that precede the definition.\\n\\nfoo();\\nsub foo { ... }\\nfoo;\\n\\nA list of arguments may be provided after the subroutine name. Arguments may be scalars, lists, or hashes.\\n\\nfoo $x, @y, %z;\\n\\nThe parameters to a subroutine need not be declared as to either number or type; in fact, they may vary from call to call. Arrays are expanded to their elements, hashes are expanded to a list of key/value pairs, and the whole lot is passed into the subroutine as one undifferentiated list of scalars.\\n\\nWhatever arguments are passed are available to the subroutine in the special array @_. The elements of @_ are aliased to the actual arguments; changing an element of @_ changes the corresponding argument.\\n\\nElements of @_ may be accessed by subscripting it in the usual way.\\n\\n$_[0], $_[1]\\n\\nHowever, the resulting code can be difficult to read, and the parameters have pass-by-reference semantics, which may be undesirable.\\n\\nOne common idiom is to assign @_ to a list of named variables.\\n\\nmy($x, $y, $z) = @_;\\n\\nThis effects both mnemonic parameter names and pass-by-value sematics. The my keyword indicates that the following variables are lexically scoped to the containing block.\\n\\nAnother idiom is to shift parameters off of @_. This is especially common when the subroutine takes only one argument.\\n\\nmy $x = shift;\\n\\nSubroutines may return values.\\n\\nreturn 42, $x, @y, %z;\\n\\nIf the subroutine does not exit via a return statement, then it returns the last expression evaluated within the subroutine body. Arrays and hashes in the return value are expanded to lists of scalars, just as they are for arguments.\\n\\nThe returned expression is evaluated in the calling context of the subroutine; this can surprise the unwary.\\n\\nsub list  {      (4, 5, 6)     }\\nsub array { @x = (4, 5, 6); @x }\\n\\n$x = list;   # returns 6 - last element of list\\n$x = array;  # returns 3 - number of elements in list\\n@x = list;   # returns (4, 5, 6)\\n@x = array;  # returns (4, 5, 6)\\n\\nA subroutine can discover its calling context with the wantarray function.\\n\\nsub either { wantarray ? (1, 2) : \"Oranges\" }\\n\\n$x = either;    # returns \"Oranges\"\\n@x = either;    # returns (1, 2)\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nRegular expressions\\n\\n    See also: Perl regular expression examples\\n\\nThe Perl language includes a specialized syntax for writing regular expressions (REs), and the interpreter contains an engine for matching strings to regular expressions. The regular expression engine uses a backtracking algorithm, extending its capabilities from simple pattern matching to string capture and substitution.\\n\\nThe Perl regular expression syntax was originally taken from Unix Version 8 regular expressions. However, it diverged before the first release of Perl, and has since grown to include many more features. Some other languages and applications are now adopting Perl compatible regular expressions in favor of POSIX regular expressions.\\n\\nThe m// (match) operator introduces a regular expression match. (The leading m may be omitted for brevity.) In the simplest case, an expression like\\n\\n $x =~ m/abc/\\n\\nevaluates to true if and only if the string $x matches the regular expression abc.\\n\\nPortions of a regular expression may be enclosed in parentheses; corresponding portions of a matching string are captured. Captured strings are assigned to the sequential built-in variables $1, $2, $3, ..., and a list of captured strings is returned as the value of the match.\\n\\n $x =~ m/a(.)c/;  # capture the character between 'a' and 'c'\\n\\nThe s/// (substitute) operator specifies a search and replace operation:\\n\\n $x =~ s/abc/aBc/;   # upcase the b\\n\\nPerl regular expressions can take modifiers. These are single-letter suffixes that modify the meaning of the expression:\\n\\n $x =~ m/abc/i;      # case-insensitive pattern match\\n $x =~ s/abc/aBc/g;  # global search and replace\\n\\nRegular expressions can be dense and cryptic. This is because regular expression syntax is extremely compact, generally using single characters or character pairs to represent its operations. Perl provides some relief from this problem with the /x modifer, which allows programmers to place whitespace and comments inside regular expressions:\\n\\n $x =~ m/a     # match 'a'\\n         .     # match any character\\n         c     # match 'c'\\n          /x;\\n\\nOne common use of regular expressions is to specify delimiters for the split operator:\\n\\n @words = split m/,/, $line;   # divide $line into comma-separated values\\n\\nThe split operator complements string capture. String capture returns the parts of a string that match a regular expression; split returns the parts that don't match.\\n[edit]\\n\\nDatabase interfaces\\n\\nPerl is widely favored for database applications. Its text handling facilities are good for generating SQL queries; arrays, hashes and automatic memory management make it easy to collect and process the returned data.\\n\\nIn early versions of Perl, database interfaces were created by relinking the interpreter with a client-side database library. This was somewhat clumsy; a particular problem was that the resulting perl executable was restricted to using just the one database interface that it was linked to. Also, relinking the interpreter was sufficiently difficult that it was only done for a few of the most important and widely used databases.\\n\\nIn Perl 5, database interfaces are implemented by Perl DBI modules. The DBI (Database Interface) module presents a single, database-independent interface to Perl applications, while the DBD:: (Database Driver) modules handle the details of accessing some 50 different databases. There are DBD:: drivers for most ANSI SQL databases.\\n[edit]\\n\\nLanguage design\\n\\nThe design of Perl can be understood as a response to three broad trends in the computer industry: falling hardware costs, rising labor costs, and improvements in compiler technology. Many earlier computer languages, such as Fortran and C, were designed to make efficient use of expensive computer hardware. In contrast, Perl is designed to make efficient use of expensive computer programmers.\\n\\nPerl has many features that ease the programmer's task at the expense of greater CPU and memory requirements. These include automatic memory management; dynamic typing; strings, lists, and hashes; regular expressions; introspection and an eval() function.\\n\\nLarry Wall was trained as a linguist, and the design of Perl is very much informed by linguistic principles. Examples include Huffman coding (common constructions should be short), good end-weighting (the important information should come first), and a large collection of language primitives. Perl favors language constructs that are natural for humans to read and write, even where they complicate the Perl interpreter.\\n\\nPerl syntax reflects the idea that \"things that are different should look different\". For example, scalars, arrays, and hashes have different leading sigils. Array indices and hash keys use different kinds of braces. Strings and regular expressions have different standard delimiters. This approach can be contrasted with languages like Lisp, where the same S-expression construct and basic syntax is used for many different purposes.\\n\\nPerl has features that support a variety of programming paradigms, such as procedural, functional, and object-oriented. At the same time, Perl does not enforce any particular paradigm, or even require the programmer to choose among them.\\n\\nThere is a broad practical bent to both the Perl language and the community and culture that surround it. The preface to Programming Perl begins, \"Perl is a language for getting your job done.\" One consequence of this is that Perl is not a tidy language. It includes features if people use them, tolerates exceptions to its rules, and employs heuristics to resolve syntactical ambiguities. Discussing the variant behaviour of built-in functions in list and scalar context, the perlfunc(1) man page says,\\n\\n    In general, they do what you want, unless you want consistency.\\n\\nPerl has several mottos that convey aspects of its design and use. One is \"There's more than one way to do it.\" (TMTOWTDI, usually pronounced 'Tim Toady'). Others are \"Perl: the Swiss Army Chainsaw of Programming Languages\" and \"No unnecessary limits\". A stated design goal of Perl is to make easy tasks easy and difficult tasks possible. Perl has also been called \"The Duct Tape of the Internet\".\\n[edit]\\n\\nOpinion\\n\\nPerl engenders strong feelings among both its proponents and its detractors.\\n[edit]\\n\\nPro\\n\\nProgrammers who like Perl typically cite its power, expressiveness, and ease of use. Perl provides infrastructure for many common programming tasks, such as string and list processing. Other tasks, such as memory management, are handled automatically and transparently. Programmers coming from other languages to Perl often find that whole classes of problems that they have struggled with in the past just don't arise in Perl. As Larry Wall put it,\\n\\n    What is the sound of Perl? Is it not the sound of a wall that people have stopped banging their heads against?\\n\\nBesides its practical benefits, many programmers simply seem to enjoy working in Perl. Early issues of The Perl Journal had a page titled \"What is Perl?\" that concluded:\\n\\n    Perl is fun. In these days of self-serving jargon, conflicting and unpredictable standards, and proprietary systems that discourage peeking under the hood, people have forgotten that programming is supposed to be fun. I don't mean the satisfaction of seeing our well-tuned programs do our bidding, but the literary act of creative writing that yields those programs. With Perl, the journey is as enjoyable as the destination ...\\n\\nWhatever the reasons, there is clearly a broad community of people who are passionate about Perl, as evidenced by the thousands of modules that have been contributed to CPAN, and the hundreds of design proposals that were submitted as RFCs for Perl 6.\\n[edit]\\n\\nCon\\n\\nA common complaint is that Perl is ugly. In particular, its prodigious use of punctuation puts off some people; Perl source code is sometimes likened to \"line noise\". In The Python Paradox, Paul Graham both acknowledges and responds to this:\\n\\n    At the mention of ugly source code, people will of course think of Perl. But the superficial ugliness of Perl is not the sort I mean. Real ugliness is not harsh-looking syntax, but having to build programs out of the wrong concepts. Perl may look like a cartoon character swearing, but there are cases where it surpasses Python conceptually.\\n\\nAnother criticism is that Perl is excessively complex and compact, and that it leads to \"write-only\" code, that is, to code that is virtually impossible to understand after it has been written. It is, of course, possible to write obscure code in any language, but Perl has perhaps more than the usual share of terse, complex and arcane language constructs to exacerbate the problem. Perl supports many such features for backwards compatibility, and for use where maintainability is expressly not a concern, such as programs that are entered and run directly on the command line.\\n\\nThe freewheeling language style that delights some Perl programmers concerns and dismays others. For example, the Perl 5 object model does not enforce data security: access to private data is restricted only by convention, not the language itself. An object created in one place may easily be modified in another; there may not be any single place where its state is definitively established. There are techniques for addressing these issues, but they are non-native and little used.\\n\\nPerl is not efficient at processor-bound tasks, and Perl data structures generally use more memory than comparable data structures in languages like C and C++.\\n[edit]\\n\\nHistory\\n\\nLarry Wall began work on Perl in 1987, and released version 1.0 to the comp.sources.misc newsgroup on December 18, 1987. The language expanded rapidly over the next few years. Perl 2, released in 1988, featured a better regular expression engine. Perl 3, released in 1989, added support for binary data.\\n\\nUntil 1991, the only documentation for Perl was a single (increasingly lengthy) man page. In 1991, Programming Perl (the Camel Book) was published, and became the de facto reference for the language. At the same time, the Perl version number was bumped to 4, not to mark a major change in the language, but to identify the version that was documented by the book.\\n\\nPerl 4 went through a series of maintenance releases, culminating in Perl 4.036 in 1993. At that point, Larry Wall abandoned Perl 4 to begin work on Perl 5. Perl 4 remains at version 4.036 to this day.\\n\\nDevelopment of Perl 5 continued into 1994. The perl5-porters mailing list was established in May 1994 to coordinate work on porting Perl 5 to different platforms. It remains the primary forum for development, maintenance, and porting of Perl 5.\\n\\nPerl 5 was released on October 17, 1994. It was a nearly complete rewrite of the interpreter, and added many new features to the language, including objects, references, packages, and modules. Importantly, modules provided a mechanism for extending the language without modifying the interpreter. This allowed the core interpreter to stabilize, even as it enabled ordinary Perl programmers to add new language features.\\n\\nOn October 26, 1995, the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network (CPAN) was established. CPAN is a collection of web sites that archive and distribute Perl sources, binary distributions, documentation, scripts, and modules. Originally, each CPAN site had to be accessed through its own URL; today, the single URL http://www.cpan.org automatically redirects to a CPAN site.\\n\\nAs of 2006, Perl 5 is still being actively maintained. It now includes Unicode support. The latest stable release is Perl 5.8.8.\\n[edit]\\n\\nFuture\\n\\n    Main article: Perl 6\\n\\nAt the 2000 Perl Conference, Jon Orwant made a case for a major new language initiative. This led to a decision to begin work on a redesign of the language, to be called Perl 6. Proposals for new language features were solicited from the Perl community at large, and over 300 RFCs were submitted.\\n\\nLarry Wall spent the next few years digesting the RFCs and synthesizing them into a coherent framework for Perl 6. He has presented his design for Perl 6 in a series of documents called apocalypses, which are numbered to correspond to chapters in Programming Perl (\"The Camel Book\"). The current, unfinalized specification of Perl 6 is encapsulated in design documents called Synopses, which are numbered to correspond to Apocalypses.\\n\\nPerl 6 is not intended to be backwards-compatible, though there will be a compatibility mode.\\n\\nIn 2001, it was decided that Perl 6 would run on a cross-language virtual machine called Parrot. This will mean that other languages targeting the Parrot will gain native access to CPAN and will allow some level of cross-language development.\\n\\nIn 2005 Audrey Tang created the pugs project, an implementation of Perl 6 in Haskell. This was and continues to act as a test platform for the Perl 6 language (separate from the development of the actual implementation) allowing the language designers to explore. The pugs project resulted in an active Perl/Haskell cross-language community centred around the Freenode #perl6 irc channel.\\n\\nA number of features in the Perl 6 language now show similarities with Haskell, and Perl 6 has been embraced by the Haskell community as a potential scripting language.\\n\\nAs of 2006 Perl 6, Parrot, and pugs are under active development.\\n[edit]\\n\\nCPAN\\n\\n    Main article: CPAN\\n\\nCPAN, the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network, is a collection of mirrored web sites that serve as a primary archive and distribution channel for Perl sources, distributions, documentation, scripts, and\\u0097especially\\u0097modules. It is commonly browsed with the search engine http://search.cpan.org/.\\n\\nThere are currently over 8,800 modules available on CPAN, contributed by over 2,500 authors. Modules are available for a wide variety of tasks, including advanced mathematics, database connectivity, and networking. Essentially everything on CPAN is freely available; much of the software is licensed under either the Artistic License, the GPL, or both. Anyone can upload software to CPAN via PAUSE, the Perl Authors Upload Server.\\n\\nModules on CPAN can be downloaded and installed by hand. However, it is common for modules to depend on other modules, and following module dependencies by hand can be tedious. Both the CPAN.pm module (included in the Perl distribution) and the improved CPANPLUS module offer command line installers that understand module dependencies; they can be configured to automatically download and install a module and, recursively, all modules that it requires.\\n\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nName\\n\\nPerl was originally named \"Pearl\", after \"the pearl of great price\" of Matthew 13:46. Larry Wall wanted to give the language a short name with positive connotations; he claims that he looked at (and rejected) every three- and four-letter word in the dictionary. He also considered naming it after his wife Gloria. Wall discovered before the language's official release that there was already a programming language named PEARL and changed the spelling of the name.\\n\\nThe name is normally capitalized (Perl) when referring to the language and uncapitalized (perl) when referring to the interpreter program itself since Unix-like filesystems are case sensitive. Before the release of the first edition of Programming Perl it was common to refer to the language as perl; Randal L. Schwartz, however, forced the uppercase language name in the book to make the name stand out better when typeset. The case distinction was subsequently adopted by the community.\\n\\nIt is not appropriate to write \"PERL\", as it is not an acronym. The spelling of PERL in all caps is therefore used as a shibboleth for detecting community outsiders. However, several backronyms have been suggested, including the humorous Pathologically Eclectic Rubbish Lister. The more serious Practical Extraction and Report Language has prevailed in many of today's manuals, including the official Perl man page. It is also consistent with the old name \"Pearl\": Practical Extraction And Report Language.\\n[edit]\\n\\nThe Camel Symbol\\n\\nPerl is generally symbolized by a camel, which was a result of the picture chosen by camel book publishers O'Reilly Media as the cover picture of Programming Perl, which consequently acquired the name The Camel Book. O'Reilly owns the symbol as a trademark, but claims to use their legal rights only to protect the \"integrity and impact of that symbol\" [3]. O'Reilly allows non-commercial use of the symbol, and provides Programming Republic of Perl logos (see above) and Powered by Perl buttons.\\n[edit]\\n\\nFun with Perl\\n\\nAs with C, obfuscated code competitions are a popular feature of Perl culture. The annual Obfuscated Perl contest makes an arch virtue of Perl's syntactic flexibility. The following program prints the text \"Just another Perl / Unix hacker\", using 32 concurrent processes coordinated by pipes. A complete explanation is available on the author's Web site.\\n\\n @P=split//,\".URRUU\\\\c8R\";@d=split//,\"\\\\nrekcah xinU / lreP rehtona tsuJ\";sub p{\\n @p{\"r$p\",\"u$p\"}=(P,P);pipe\"r$p\",\"u$p\";++$p;($q*=2)+=$f=!fork;map{$P=$P[$f^ord\\n ($p{$_})&6];$p{$_}=/ ^$P/ix?$P:close$_}keys%p}p;p;p;p;p;map{$p{$_}=~/^[P.]/&&\\n close$_}%p;wait until$?;map{/^r/&&<$_>}%p;$_=$d[$q];sleep rand(2)if/\\\\S/;print\\n\\nSimilar to obfuscated code but with a different purpose, \"Perl Poetry\" is the practice of writing poems that can actually be compiled by perl. This hobby is more or less unique to Perl due to the large number of regular English words used in the language. New poems are regularly published in the Perl Monks site's Perl Poetry section.\\n\\nAnother popular pastime is \"Perl Golf.\" As with the physical sport, the goal is to reduce the number of strokes that it takes to complete a particular objective, but here \"strokes\" refers to keystrokes rather than swings of a golf club. A task, such as \"scan an input string and return the longest palindrome that it contains\", is proposed and participants try to outdo each other by writing solutions that require fewer and fewer characters of Perl source code.\\n\\nAnother tradition among Perl hackers is writing JAPHs, which are short obfuscated programs that print out the phrase \"Just another Perl hacker,\". The \"canonical\" JAPH includes the comma at the end, although this is often omitted, and many variants on the theme have been created (example: [4], which prints \"Just Another Perl Pirate!\").\\n\\nOne interesting Perl module is Lingua::Romana::Perligata. This module translates the source code of a script that uses it from Latin into Perl, allowing the programmer to write executable programs in Latin.\\n\\nThe Perl community has set aside the \"Acme\" namespace for modules that are fun or experimental in nature. Some of the Acme modules are deliberately implemented in amusing ways. Some examples:\\n\\n    * Acme::Bleach, one of the first modules in the Acme:: namespace, allows the program's source code to be \"whitened\" (i.e., all characters replaced with whitespace) and yet still work. This is an example of a source filter. There are also a number of other source filters in the Acme namespace.\\n    * Acme::Hello simplifies the process of writing a \"Hello, World!\" program\\n    * Acme::Currency allows you to change the \"$\" prefix for scalar variables to some other character\\n    * Acme::ProgressBar is a horribly inefficient way to indicate progress for a task\\n    * Acme::VerySign satirizes the widely-criticized VeriSign Site Finder service\\n    * Acme::Don't implements the logical opposite of the do keyword\\u0097don't, which does not execute the provided block.\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nSee also\\nPortal:Free software\\n\\tFree software Portal\\n\\n    * Perl 6\\n    * CPAN\\n    * The Perl Foundation\\n    * Larry Wall\\n    * Just another Perl hacker\\n    * Obfuscated Perl contest\\n    * POE- the Perl Object Environment\\n    * Perl Mongers\\n    * Perl Data Language\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nReferences\\n[edit]\\n\\nBooks\\nWikibooks\\nWikibooks has more about this subject:\\nPerl\\n\\n    * Programming Perl (the Camel book), ISBN 0-596-00027-8\\n    * Learning Perl, Fourth Edition (the Llama book), ISBN 0-596-10105-8\\n    * Perl Cookbook, ISBN 0-596-00313-7\\n\\n(Also see Books under External links, below.)\\n[edit]\\n\\nPerl man pages\\n\\nThe Perl man pages are included in the Perl source distribution.

This means that, rather than forcing coders to adopt one particular style of coding, it permits several. Object orientation, structured programming, functional programming, aspect-oriented programming, and more recently, design by contract are all supported. Python is dynamically type-checked and uses garbage collection for memory management. An important feature of Python is dynamic name resolution, which binds method and variable names during program execution.\\n\\nWhile offering choice in coding methodology, Python's designers reject exuberant syntax, such as in Perl, in favor of a sparser, less cluttered one. As with Perl, Python's developers expressly promote a particular \"culture\" or ideology based on what they want the language to be, favoring language forms they see as \"beautiful\", \"explicit\" and \"simple\". For the most part, Perl and Python users differ in their interpretation of these terms and how they are best implemented (see TIMTOWTDI and PythonPhilosophy).\\n\\nAnother important goal of the Python developers is making Python fun to use. This is reflected in the origin of the name (after the television series Monty Python's Flying Circus), in the common practice of using Monty Python references in example code, and in an occasionally playful approach to tutorials and reference materials. For example, the metasyntactic variables often used in Python literature are spam and eggs, instead of the traditional foo and bar.\\n\\nPython is sometimes referred to as a \"scripting language\". In practice, it is used as a dynamic programming language for both application development and occasional scripting. Python has been used to develop many large software projects such as the Zope application server and the Mnet and BitTorrent file sharing systems. It is also extensively used by Google. [1]\\n\\nAnother important goal of the language is ease of extensibility. New built-in modules are easily written in C or C++. Python can also be used as an extension language for existing modules and applications that need a programmable interface.\\n\\nThough the design of Python is somewhat hostile to functional programming and the Lisp tradition, there are significant parallels between the philosophy of Python and that of minimalist Lisp-family languages such as Scheme. Many past Lisp programmers have found Python appealing for this reason.\\n[edit]\\n\\nHistory\\nPython logo, 1990s-2005\\nEnlarge\\nPython logo, 1990s-2005\\n\\nPython was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at CWI in the Netherlands as a successor of the ABC programming language. Guido is Python's principal author, although it includes many contributions from others. Guido's continuing central role in deciding the direction of Python is jokingly acknowledged by referring to him as its Benevolent Dictator for Life (BDFL).\\n\\nThe last version released from CWI was Python 1.2. In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI) in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the software. Python 1.6 was the last of the versions released by CNRI. In 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team. Python 2.0 was the first and only release from BeOpen.com.\\n\\nPython had been available under a free software license, but the license was incompatible with the GNU General Public License (GPL). Following the release of Python 1.6, and after Guido van Rossum left CNRI to work with commercial software developers, it became clear that the ability to use Python with software available under the GPL was very desirable. CNRI and the Free Software Foundation (FSF) interacted to develop enabling wording changes to the Python license which would make Python's license GPL-compatible. That year, Guido was awarded the FSF Award for the Advancement of Free Software.\\n\\nPython 1.6.1 is essentially the same as Python 1.6, with a few minor bug fixes, and with the new GPL-compatible license. Python 2.1 also includes this new license and is a derivative work of Python 1.6.1, as well as of Python 2.0. Current versions of the license are called the Python Software Foundation License.\\n\\nAfter Python 2.0 was released by BeOpen.com, Guido van Rossum and the other PythonLabs developers joined Digital Creations. All intellectual property added from this point on, starting with Python 2.1 and its alpha and beta releases, is owned by the Python Software Foundation (PSF), a non-profit organization modeled after the Apache Software Foundation.\\n[edit]\\n\\nThe future\\n\\nPython developers have an ongoing discussion of a future \"Python 3000\" that will break backwards compatibility with the 2.x series in order to repair perceived flaws in the language. The guiding principle is to \"reduce feature duplication by removing old ways of doing things\". There is no definite schedule for Python 3000, but a PEP (Python Enhancement Proposal) that details planned changes exists. [2]\\n\\nAmong other changes, Python 3000 plans to:\\n\\n    * move map, filter and reduce out of the built-in namespace (the rationale being that map and filter are expressed more clearly as list comprehensions, and reduce more clearly as an accumulation loop)\\n    * add support for optional type declarations\\n    * unify the str/unicode types, and introduce a separate mutable bytes type\\n    * convert built-ins to returning iterators (instead of lists), where appropriate\\n    * remove backwards-compatibily features like classic classes, classic division, string exceptions, implicit relative imports\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nUsage\\n\\n    Main article: Python software\\n\\nThe Python programming language is actively used in industry and academia for a wide variety of purposes.\\n[edit]\\n\\nSyntax\\n\\nPython was designed to be a highly readable language. It aims toward an uncluttered visual layout, uses English keywords frequently where other languages use punctuation, and has notably fewer syntactic constructions than many structured languages such as C, Perl, or Pascal.\\n\\nFor instance, Python has only two structured loop forms:\\n\\n   1. for item in iterator:, which loops over elements of a list or iterator\\n   2. while expression:, which loops as long as a boolean expression is true.\\n\\nIt thus forgoes the more complex, C-style for (initialize; end condition; increment) syntax (common in many popular languages) And it does not have any of the common alternative loop syntaxes such as do...while, repeat until, etc. though of course equivalents can be expressed. Likewise, it has only if...elif...else for branching -- no switch or labeled goto (goto was implemented as a joke for 1 April 2004, in an add-on module).\\n[edit]\\n\\nIndentation\\n\\nOne unusual aspect of Python's syntax is its use of whitespace to delimit program blocks (the off-side rule). Sometimes termed \"the whitespace thing\", it is one aspect of Python syntax that many programmers otherwise unfamiliar with Python have heard of, since it is nearly unique among currently widespread languages.\\n\\nIn so-called \"free-format\" languages, that use the block structure ultimately derived from ALGOL, blocks of code are set off with braces ({ }) or keywords. In all these languages, however, programmers conventionally indent the code within a block, to set it off visually from the surrounding code.\\n\\nPython, instead, borrows a feature from the lesser-known language ABC\\u0097instead of punctuation or keywords, it uses this indentation itself to indicate the run of a block. A brief example will make this clear. Here are C and Python recursive functions which do the same thing\\u0097computing the factorial of an integer:\\n\\nFactorial function in C:\\n\\nint factorial(int x)\\n{\\n    if (x == 0) {\\n        return 1;\\n    }\\n    else {\\n        return x * factorial(x-1);\\n    }\\n}\\n\\nFactorial function in Python:\\n\\ndef factorial(x):\\n    if x == 0:\\n        return 1\\n    else:\\n        return x * factorial(x-1)\\n\\nSome programmers used to ALGOL-style languages, in which whitespace is semantically empty, find this confusing or even offensive. A few have drawn an unflattering comparison to the column-oriented style used on punched-card Fortran systems. When ALGOL was new, it was a major development to have \"free-form\" languages in which only symbols mattered and not their position on the line.\\n\\nTo Python programmers, however, \"the whitespace thing\" is simply the enforcement of a convention that programmers in ALGOL-style languages already follow anyway. They also point out that the free-form syntax has the disadvantage that, since indentation is ignored, good indentation cannot be enforced. Thus, incorrectly indented code may be misleading, since a human reader and a compiler could interpret it differently. Here is an example:\\n\\nMisleading indentation in C:\\n\\nfor (i = 0; i < 20; ++i)\\n   a();\\n   b();\\n   c();\\n\\nThis code is intended to call functions a(), b(), and c() 20 times\\u0097and at first glance, that's what it appears to do. However, the interpreted code block is just {a();}. The code calls a() 20 times, and then calls b() and c() one time each. This sort of mistake can be very hard to spot when reading code. In Python, if the indentation looks correct, it is correct.\\n\\nThe whitespace thing has minor disadvantages. Both space characters and tab characters are currently accepted as forms of indentation. Since they are not visually distinguishable (in many tools), mixing spaces and tabs can create bugs that take specific efforts to find (a perennial suggestion among Python users has been removing tabs as block markers\\u0097except, of course, among those Python users who propound removing spaces instead).\\n\\nBecause whitespace is syntactically significant, it is not always possible for a program to automatically correct the indentation on Python code as can be done with C or Lisp code. Moreover, formatting routines which remove whitespace\\u0097for instance, many Internet forums\\u0097can completely destroy the syntax of a Python program, whereas a program in a bracketed language would merely become more difficult to read.\\n[edit]\\n\\nData structures\\n\\nSince Python is a dynamically typed language, Python values, not variables, carry type. This has implications for many aspects of the way the language functions.\\n\\nAll variables in Python hold references to objects, and these references are passed to functions by value; a function cannot change the value a variable references in its calling function. Some people (including Guido van Rossum himself) have called this parameter-passing scheme \"Call by object reference.\"\\n\\nAmong dynamically typed languages, Python is moderately type-checked. Implicit conversion is defined for numeric types, so one may validly multiply a complex number by a long integer (for instance) without explicit casting. However, there is no implicit conversion between (e.g.) numbers and strings; a string is an invalid argument to a mathematical function expecting a number.\\n[edit]\\n\\nBase types\\n\\nPython has a broad range of basic data types. Alongside conventional integer and floating point arithmetic, it transparently supports arbitrary-precision arithmetic and complex numbers.\\n\\nPython supports a panoply of string operations. Strings in Python are immutable, so a string operation such as a substitution of characters, that in other programming languages might alter a string in place, returns a new string in Python. Performance considerations sometimes push for using special techniques in programs that modify strings intensively, such as joining character arrays into strings only as needed.\\n[edit]\\n\\nCollection types\\n\\nOne of the very useful aspects of Python is the concept of collection (or container) types. In general a collection is an object that contains other objects in a way that is easily referenced or indexed. Collections come in two basic forms: sequences and mappings.\\n\\nThe ordered sequential types are lists (dynamic arrays), tuples, and strings. All sequences are indexed positionally (0 through length - 1) and all but strings can contain any type of object, including multiple types in the same sequence. Both strings and tuples are immutable, making them perfect candidates for dictionary keys (see below). Lists, on the other hand, are mutable; elements can be inserted, deleted, modified, appended, or sorted in-place.\\n\\nOn the other side of the collections coin are mappings, which are unordered types implemented in the form of dictionaries which \"map\" a set of immutable keys, to corresponding elements much like a mathematical function. The keys in a dictionary must be of an immutable Python type such as an integer or a string. For example, one could define a dictionary having a string \"foo\" mapped to the integer 42 or vice versa. This is done under the covers via a hash function which makes for faster lookup times, but is also the culprit for a dictionary's lack of order and is the reason mutable objects (i.e. other dictionaries or lists) cannot be used as keys. Dictionaries are also central to the internals of the language as they reside at the core of all Python objects and classes: the mapping between variable names (strings) and the values which the names reference is stored as a dictionary (see Object system). Since these dictionaries are directly accessible (via an object's __dict__ attribute), meta-programming is a straightforward and natural process in Python.\\n\\nA set collection type was added to the core language in version 2.4. A set is an unindexed, unordered collection that contains no duplicates, and implements set theoretic operations such as union, intersection, difference, symmetric difference, and subset testing. There are two types of sets: set and frozenset, the only difference being that set is mutable and frozenset is immutable. Elements in a set must be hashable and immutable. Thus, for example, a frozenset can be an element of a regular set whereas the opposite is not true.\\n\\nPython also provides extensive collection manipulating abilities such as built in containment checking and a generic iteration protocol.\\n[edit]\\n\\nObject system\\n\\nIn Python, everything is an object, even classes. Classes, as objects, have a class, which is known as their metaclass. Python also supports multiple inheritance and mixins (see also MixinsForPython).\\n\\nThe language supports extensive introspection of types and classes. Types can be read and compared\\u0097 types are instances of type. The attributes of an object can be extracted as a dictionary.\\n\\nOperators can be overloaded in Python by defining special member functions\\u0097for instance, defining __add__ on a class permits one to use the + operator on members of that class.\\n[edit]\\n\\nOperators\\n[edit]\\n\\nComparison operators\\n\\nThe basic comparison operators such as ==, <, >=, and so forth, are used on all manner of values. Numbers, strings, sequences, and mappings can all be compared. Although disparate types (such as a str and a int) are defined to have a consistent relative ordering, this is considered a historical design quirk, and will no longer be allowed in Python 3000.\\n\\nChained comparison expressions such as a < b < c have roughly the meaning that they have in mathematics, rather than the unusual meaning found in C and similar languages. The terms are evaluated and compared in order. The operation is short circuit, meaning that evaluation stops as soon as the expression is proven false: if a < b is false, c is never evaluated.\\n\\nFor expressions without side effects, a < b < c is equivalent to a < b and b < c. However, there is a substantial difference when the expressions have side effects. a < f(x) < b will evaluate f(x) exactly once, whereas a < f(x) and f(x) < b may evaluate it once or twice.\\n[edit]\\n\\nLogical operators\\n\\nPython 2.2 and earlier does not have an explicit boolean type. In all versions of Python, boolean operators treat zero values or empty values such as \"\", 0, None, 0.0, [], and {} as false, while in general treating non-empty, non-zero values as true. In Python 2.2.1 the boolean constants True and False were added to the language (subclassed from 1 and 0). Thus, the binary comparison operators such as == and >, return either True or False. The lazily evaluated boolean operations, and and or, return the value of the last evaluated subexpression, in order to preserve backwards compatibility. For example, as of Python 2.2.1 the expression (2 == 2) evaluates to True, the expression (4 and 5) evaluates to 5, and the expression (4 or 5) evaluates to 4.\\n[edit]\\n\\nFunctional programming\\n\\nAs mentioned above, another strength of Python is the availability of a functional programming style. As may be expected, this makes working with lists and other collections much more straightforward. One such construction is the list comprehension, as seen here in calculating the first five powers of two:\\n\\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\\npowers_of_two = [2**n for n in numbers]\\n\\nThe Quicksort algorithm can be expressed elegantly using list comprehensions:\\n\\ndef qsort(L):\\n  if L == []: return []\\n  pivot = L[0]\\n  return qsort([x for x in L[1:] if x < pivot]) + [pivot] + \\\\\\n         qsort([y for y in L[1:] if y >= pivot])\\n\\nAlthough execution of this naïve form of Quicksort is less space-efficient than forms which alter the sequence in-place, it is often cited as an example of the expressive power of list comprehensions.\\n[edit]\\n\\nFirst-class functions\\n\\nIn Python, functions are first-class objects that can be created and passed around dynamically.\\n\\nPython's lambda construct can be used to create anonymous functions within expressions. Lambdas are however limited to containing expressions; statements can only be used in named functions created with the def statement. (However, any type of control flow can in principle be implemented within lambda expressions[3] by short-circuiting the and and or operators.)\\n[edit]\\n\\nClosures\\n\\nPython has had support for lexical closures since version 2.2. Python's syntax, though, sometimes leads programmers of other languages to think that closures are not supported. Since names are bound locally, the trick to creating a closure is using a mutable container within enclosing scope. Many Python tutorials explain this usage, but it is an atypical style in Python programs.\\n[edit]\\n\\nGenerators\\n\\nIntroduced in Python 2.2 as an optional feature and finalized in version 2.3, generators are Python's mechanism for lazy evaluation of a function that would otherwise return a space-prohibitive or computationally intensive list.\\n\\nThis is an example to lazily generate the prime numbers:\\n\\nfrom itertools import count\\ndef generate_primes(stop_at=None):\\n    primes = []\\n    for n in count(2):\\n        if stop_at is not None and n > stop_at:\\n            return\\n        composite = False\\n        for p in primes:\\n            if not n % p:\\n                composite = True\\n                break\\n            elif p**2 > n: \\n                break\\n        if not composite:\\n            primes.append(n)\\n            yield n\\n\\nTo use this function simply call, e.g.:\\n\\nfor i in generate_primes():  # iterate over ALL primes\\n    if i > 100: break\\n    print i\\n\\nThe definition of a generator appears identical to that of a function, except the keyword yield is used in place of return. However, a generator is an object with persistent state, which can repeatedly enter and leave the same dynamic extent. A generator call can then be used in place of a list, or other structure whose elements will be iterated over. Whenever the for-loop in the example requires the next item, the generator is called, and yields the next item.\\n[edit]\\n\\nGenerator expressions\\n\\n    Further information: List comprehension\\n\\nIntroduced in Python 2.4, generator expressions are the lazy evaluation equivalent of list comprehensions. Using the prime number generator provided in the above section, we might define a lazy, but not quite infinite collection.\\n\\nfrom itertools import islice\\nfirst_million_primes = (i for i in generate_primes() if i < 1000000)\\ntwo_thousandth_prime = list(islice(first_million_primes,2001))[2000]\\n\\nMost of the memory and time needed to generate this many primes will not be used until the needed element is actually accessed. Unfortunately, you cannot perform simple indexing and slicing of generators, but must use the itertools modules or \"roll your own\" loops. In contrast, a list comprehension is functionally equivalent, but is greedy in performing all the work:\\n\\nfirst_million_primes = [i for i in generate_primes(2000000) if i < 1000000]\\ntwo_thousandth_prime = first_million_primes[2000]\\n\\nThe list comprehension will immediately create a large list (with 78498 items, in the example, but transiently creating a list of primes under two million), even if most elements are never accessed. The generator comprehension is more parsimonious.\\n[edit]\\n\\nObjects\\n\\nPython supports most object oriented programming techniques. It allows polymorphism, not only within a class hierarchy but also by duck typing. Any object can be used for any type, and it will work so long as it has the proper methods and attributes. And everything in Python is an object, including classes, functions, numbers and modules. Python also has support for metaclasses, an advanced tool for enhancing classes' functionality. Naturally, inheritance, including multiple inheritance, is supported. It has limited support for private variables using name mangling. See the \"Classes\" section of the tutorial for details. Many Python users don't feel the need for private variables, though. The slogan \"We're all consenting adults here\" is used to describe this attitude. Some consider information hiding to be unpythonic, in that it suggests that the class in question contains unaesthetic or ill-planned internals.\\n\\nFrom the tutorial: As is true for modules, classes in Python do not put an absolute barrier between definition and user, but rather rely on the politeness of the user not to \"break into the definition.\"\\n\\nOOP doctrines such as the use of accessor methods to read data members are not enforced in Python. Just as Python offers functional-programming constructs but does not attempt to demand referential transparency, it offers (and extensively uses!) its object system but does not demand OOP behavior. Moreover, it is always possible to redefine the class using properties so that when a certain variable is set or retrieved in calling code, it really invokes a function call, so that foo.x = y might really invoke foo.set_x(y). This nullifies the practical advantage of accessor functions, and it remains OOP because the property 'x' becomes a legitimate part of the object's interface: it need not reflect an implementation detail.\\n\\nIn version 2.2 of Python, \"new-style\" classes were introduced. With new-style classes, objects and types were unified, allowing the subclassing of types. Even new types entirely can be defined, complete with custom behavior for infix operators. This allows for many radical things to be done syntactically within Python. A new multiple inheritance model was adopted with new-style classes, making a much more logical order of inheritance. The new method __getattribute__ was also defined for unconditional handling of attribute access.\\n\\nFor a useful introduction to the principles of object oriented programming, read Introduction to OOP with Python.\\n[edit]\\n\\nExceptions\\n\\nPython supports (and extensively uses) exception handling as a means of testing for error conditions and other \"exceptional\" events in a program. Indeed, it is even possible to trap the exception caused by a syntax error.\\n\\nPython style calls for the use of exceptions whenever an error condition might arise. Indeed, rather than testing for access to a file or resource before actually using it, it is conventional in Python to just go ahead and try to use it, catching the exception if access is rejected.\\n\\nExceptions can also be used as a more general means of non-local transfer of control, even when an error is not at issue. For instance, the Mailman mailing list software, written in Python, uses exceptions to jump out of deeply-nested message-handling logic when a decision has been made to reject a message or hold it for moderator approval.\\n\\nExceptions are often, especially in threaded situations, used as an alternative to the if-block. A commonly-invoked motto is EAFP, or \"It is Easier to Ask for Forgiveness than to ask for Permission.\" In this first code sample, there is an explicit checks for the attribute (i.e., \"asks permission\"):\\n\\nif hasattr(foo, 'bar'):\\n    baz = foo.bar\\nelse:\\n    handle_error()\\n\\nThis second sample follows the EAFP paradigm:\\n\\ntry:\\n    baz = foo.bar\\nexcept AttributeError:\\n    handle_error()\\n\\nThese two code samples have the same effect, although there will be performance differences. When foo has the attribute bar, the EAFP sample will run faster. When foo does not have the attribute bar (the \"exceptional\" case), the EAFP sample will run significantly slower. The Python programmer usually writes for code readability first, then uses Python's code profiling tools for performance analysis to determine if further optimization is required. In most cases, the EAFP paradigm results in faster and more readable code.\\n[edit]\\n\\nComments and docstrings\\n\\nPython has two ways to annotate Python code. One is by using comments to indicate what some part of the code does.\\n\\n def getline():\\n     return sys.stdin.readline()       # Get one line and return it\\n\\nComments begin with the hash character (\"#\") and are terminated by the end of line. Python does not support comments that span more than one line. The other way is to use docstrings (documentation string), that is a string that is located alone without assignment as the first line within a module, class, method or function. Such strings can be delimited with \" or ' for single line strings, or may span multiple lines if delimited with either \"\"\" or ''' which is Python's notation for specifying multi-line strings. However, the style guide for the language specifies that triple double quotes (\"\"\") are preferred for both single and multi-line docstrings.\\n\\nSingle line docstring:\\n\\n def getline():\\n     \"\"\"Get one line from stdin and return it.\"\"\"\\n     return sys.stdin.readline()\\n\\nMulti-line docstring:\\n\\n def getline():\\n     \"\"\"Get one line\\n        from stdin\\n        and return it.\"\"\"\\n     return sys.stdin.readline()\\n\\nDocstrings can be as large as the programmer wants and contain line breaks (if multi-line strings are used). In contrast with comments, docstrings are themselves Python objects and are part of the interpreted code that Python runs. That means that a running program can retrieve its own docstrings and manipulate that information. But the normal usage is to give other programmers information about how to invoke the object being documented in the docstring.\\n\\nThere are tools available that can extract the docstrings to generate an API documentation from the code. Docstring documentation can also be accessed from the interpreter with the help() function, or from the shell with the pydoc command.\\n\\nThe doctest standard module uses interactions copied from Python shell sessions into docstrings, to create tests.\\n[edit]\\n\\nImplementations\\n\\nThe standard Python interpreter also supports an interactive mode in which it acts as a kind of shell: expressions can be entered one at a time, and the result of their evaluation is seen immediately. This is a boon for those learning the language and experienced developers alike: snippets of code can be tested in interactive mode before integrating them into a proper program.\\n\\nPython also includes a unit testing framework for creating exhaustive test suites. While static typing aficionados see this as a replacement for a static type-checking system, Python programmers largely do not share this view.\\n\\nStandard Python does not support continuations, and according to Guido van Rossum, never will. However, better support for coroutine-like functionality is planned, by extending Python's generators [4].\\n[edit]\\n\\nStandard library\\nPython comes with \"batteries included\"\\nEnlarge\\nPython comes with \"batteries included\"\\n\\nPython has a large standard library, which makes it well suited to many tasks. This comes from a so-called \"batteries included\" philosophy for Python modules. The modules of the standard library can be augmented with custom modules written in either C or Python. The standard library is particularly well tailored to writing Internet-facing applications, with a large number of standard formats and protocols (such as MIME and HTTP) supported. Modules for creating graphical user interfaces, connecting to relational databases, arithmetic with arbitrarily precise decimals, and manipulating regular expressions are also included.\\n\\nThe standard library is one of Python's greatest strengths. The bulk of it is cross-platform compatible, meaning that even heavily leveraged Python programs can often run on Unix, Windows, Macintosh, and other platforms without change.\\n\\nIt is currently being debated whether or not third-party but open source Python modules such as Twisted, NumPy, or wxPython should be included in the standard library, in accordance with the batteries included philosophy.\\n[edit]\\n\\nSupported platforms\\n\\nThe most popular (and therefore best maintained) platforms Python runs on are Linux, BSD, Mac OS X, Microsoft Windows and Java (this JVM version is a separate implementation). Other supported platforms include:\\n\\nUnix-like\\n\\n    * AIX operating system\\n    * BSD\\n    * FreeBSD\\n    * NetBSD\\n    * Linux\\n    * OpenBSD\\n    * SPARC Solaris\\n    * Other Unixes, e.g. Irix\\n\\n\\t\\n\\nDesktop OS's\\n\\n    * Amiga\\n    * AROS\\n    * BeOS\\n    * Mac OS 9\\n    * Mac OS X\\n    * Microsoft Windows\\n    * OS/2\\n    * RISC OS (formerly Acorn)\\n\\n\\t\\n\\nSpecial and embedded\\n\\n    * GP2X\\n    * Java virtual machine\\n    * Nokia 770 Internet Tablet\\n    * Palm OS\\n    * PlayStation 2\\n    * PlayStation Portable\\n    * Psion\\n    * QNX\\n    * Sharp Zaurus\\n    * Symbian OS\\n    * Windows CE/Pocket PC\\n    * Xbox (Used in XBMC)\\n    * VxWorks\\n\\n\\t\\n\\nMainframe and other\\n\\n    * AS/400\\n    * OS/390\\n    * Plan 9\\n    * VMS\\n    * z/OS\\n\\nMost of the third-party libraries for Python (and even some first-party ones) are only available on Windows, Linux, BSD, and Mac OS X.\\n\\nPython was originally developed as a scripting language for the Amoeba operating system capable of making system calls; however, that version is no longer maintained.\\n[edit]\\n\\nNeologisms\\n\\nA few neologisms have come into common use within the Python community. One of the most common is \"pythonic\", which can have a wide range of meanings related to program style. To say that a piece of code is pythonic is to say that it uses Python idioms well; that it is natural or shows fluency in the language. Likewise, to say of an interface or language feature that it is pythonic is to say that it works well with Python idioms; that its use meshes well with the rest of the language.\\n\\nIn contrast, a mark of unpythonic code is that it attempts to \"write C++ (or Lisp, or Perl) code in Python\"\\u0097that is, provides a rough transcription rather than an idiomatic translation of forms from another language.\\n\\nThe prefix Py- can be used to show that something is related to Python. Examples of the use of this prefix in names of Python applications or libraries include Pygame, a binding of SDL to Python (commonly used to create games), PyUI, a GUI encoded entirely in Python, and PySol, a series of solitaire card games programmed in Python.\\n\\nUsers and admirers of Python\\u0097most especially those considered knowledgeable or experienced\\u0097are often referred to as Pythonists, Pythonistas, and Pythoneers.\\n[edit]\\n\\nSee also\\nPortal:Free software\\n\\tFree software Portal\\n\\n    * Perl programming language\\n    * Ruby programming language\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nReferences\\n\\n    * The Python Language Reference Manual by Guido van Rossum and Fred L.
